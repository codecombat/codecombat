/**
 * Test stubs for PageAvatarSelector
 *
 * The user flow is as expected:
 *  - User can select an avatar.
 *  - User clicks Next to save avatar selection state and emit completed event.
 *
 * Failure for an avatar thangType to load is appropriately handled.
 *
 * The correct thangType is rendered for each avatar.
 *
 * If the avatars are being created from data, test that the data creates
 * appropriate components.
