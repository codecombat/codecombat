        span  
        span(data-i18n="about.who_description_suffix")
          | in 2008, growing it to the #1 web and iOS application 
          | for learning to write Chinese and Japanese characters.

        | Why CodeCombat?
      
      p(data-i18n="about.why_paragraph_1")
        | When making Skritter, George didn't know how to program and was constantly 
        | frustrated by his inability to implement his ideas. Afterwards, 
        | he tried learning, but the lessons were too slow. His housemate, 
        | wanting to reskill and stop teaching, tried Codecademy, but "got bored." 
        | Each week another friend started Codecademy, then dropped off. 
        | We realized it was the same problem we'd solved with Skritter: 
        | people learning a skill via slow, intensive lessons when what they need is fast,
        | extensive practice. We know how to fix that.
    
      p(data-i18n="about.why_paragraph_2")
        | Need to learn to code? You don't need lessons. 
        | You need to write a lot of code and have a great time doing it.

      p
        span(data-i18n="about.why_paragraph_3_prefix")
          | That's what programming is about. It's gotta be fun.

        span  
        span(data-i18n="about.why_paragraph_3_suffix")
          | That's why CodeCombat is a multiplayer game,
          | not a gamified lesson course. We won't stop 
          | until you can't stop--but this time, that's a good thing.
