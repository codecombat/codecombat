Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

  p We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.

  p All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.

  p
    strong Do we use 'cookies'?

  p Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

  p We use cookies to:
    ul
      li Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.
      li Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third party services that track this information on our behalf.

  p You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

  p
    strong Third Party Disclosure

  p We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. 

  p However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

  p
    strong Third party links

Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

  p
    strong Google

  p
    span.spr Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by
    a(href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en") Google's Advertising Principles
    span . They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.

  p Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. We have implemented Google's Demographics and Interests Reporting feature.

  p We along with third-party vendors, such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions, and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.

  p Opting out: Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising initiative opt out page or permanently using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.

  p
    strong California Online Privacy Protection Act

  p
    span.spr CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.

    | .

  p According to CalOPPA: users can visit our site anonymously; we link to this Privacy Policy on the home page; and our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the home page.

  p Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page. Users are able to change their personal information by logging into their account or by emailing us.

  p
    strong How does our site handle do not track signals?

  p We generally attempt to honor Do Not Track (DNT) browser signals when possible but cannot guarantee 100% coverage.

  p
    strong Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?

  p Yeah.

  p
    strong COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

  p When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

  p We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Please contact us at team@codecombat.com if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child under 13 without proper parental consents so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.

  p
    strong Fair Information Practices

  p The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

  p In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach occur, we will notify the affected users via email within 7 business days.

  p We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

  p
    strong CAN-SPAM Act

  p The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

  p We collect your email address in order to:
    ul
      li Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
      li Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders
      li We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.
      li Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred

  p To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:
    ul
      li NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses
      li Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way
      li Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters
      li Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
      li Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly
      li Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email

  p If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can change your email settings in your account preferences, email us, or follow the instructions at the bottom of each email, and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
