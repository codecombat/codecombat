        ul
          li 
            a(href="/editor/level", data-i18n="community.level_editor")
            | : fork, edit, or build your own CodeCombat levels. New levels can be kept private or published to the community.
          li 
            a(href="/editor/thang", data-i18n="editor.thang_title")
            | : modify or import new art assets for the game using our powerful editor.
          li 
            a(href="/editor/article", data-i18n="editor.article_title")
            | : edit or create documentation used in CodeCombat levels.

      p Right now most of our editing tools are very rough, but we are improving them constantly and welcome your feedback.
