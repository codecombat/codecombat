          strong We have high hopes for CodeCombat. 
          | We want to be where programmers of all stripes come to learn and play together, 
          | introduce others to the wonderful world of coding,
          | and reflect the best parts of the community.
          | We can't and don't want to do that alone;
          | what makes projects like GitHub, Stack Overflow and Linux great are the people who
          | use them and build on them.
          | To that end, 
          a(href="https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat") CodeCombat is totally open source
          | , and we aim to provide as many ways as possible for you to take part and
          | make this project as much yours as ours.
        p We hope you'll join our party!
