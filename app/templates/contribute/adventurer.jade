      h2 Adventurer (Level Playtester)
      p Let's be clear about your role: you are the tank. You're going to take heavy damage.
        | We need people to try out brand-new levels and help identify how to make things better.
        | The pain will be enormous; making good games is a long process and no one gets
        | it right the first time.
        | If you can endure and have a high constitution score, then this class might be for you.
      
      h4 Class Attributes
      ul
        li A thirst for learning. You want to learn how to code and we want to teach you how to code.
          | You'll probably be doing most of the teaching in this case, though.
        li Charismatic. Be gentle but articulate about what needs improving, and offer suggestions
          | on how to improve.
