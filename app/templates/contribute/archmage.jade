      p One of the best parts about building games is they synthesize so many different things.
        | Graphics, sound, real-time networking, social networking, and of course many of the
        | more common aspects of programming, from low-level database management, 
        | and server administration to user facing design and interface building. 
        | There's a lot to do, and if you're an experienced programmer with a hankering
        | to really dive into the nitty-gritty of CodeCombat, this class might be for you.

      p Right now we have open-sourced two of our tools on the project: 
        a(href="https://github.com/codecombat/aether") Aether
        |  and 
        a(href="https://github.com/codecombat/treema") Treema
        | . We are also open sourcing everything momentarily, so stay tuned for access to the main repo!
        | We would love to have your help building out the best programming game ever.

          | If you're a fan of Ruby or Python, you'll feel right at home.
          | It's just JavaScript, but with a nicer syntax.
        li Some experience in programming and personal initiative.
