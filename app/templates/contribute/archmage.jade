        | One of the best parts about building games is they synthesize so many different things.
        | Graphics, sound, real-time networking, social networking, and of course many of the
        | more common aspects of programming, from low-level database management, 
        | and server administration to user facing design and interface building. 
        | There's a lot to do, and if you're an experienced programmer with a hankering
        | to really dive into the nitty-gritty of CodeCombat, this class might be for you.
        | We would love to have your help building the best programming game ever.
