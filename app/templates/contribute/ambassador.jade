      p This is a community we're building, and you are the connections.
        | We've got Olark chats, emails, and social networks with lots of people to talk with
        | and help get acquainted with the game and learn from.
        | If you want to help people get involved and have fun, and get a good feel of the pulse of
        | CodeCombat and where we're going, then this class might be for you.

        | This will be a great way for ambassadors to do their thing. We'll keep you posted!
