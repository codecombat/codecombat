      p CodeCombat isn't just going to be a bunch of levels.
        | It will also include a resource for knowledge, a wiki of programming concepts that levels can hook into.
        | That way rather than each Artisan having to describe in detail what a comparison operator is, they
        | can simply link their level to the Article describing them that is already written for the player's edification.
        | Something along the lines of what the 
        a(href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide") Mozilla Developer Network 
        | has built. If your idea of fun is articulating the concepts of programming in Markdown form,
        | then this class might be for you.
