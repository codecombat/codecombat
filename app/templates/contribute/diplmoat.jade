      h3 Diplomat (Translator)
      p So, if there's one thing we learned from the 
        a(href="blog.codecombat.com/post/64658141307/codecombat-in-y-combinator") launch in October
        | , it's that there
        | is sizeable interest in CodeCombat in other countries, particularly Brazil!
        | We're building a corps of translators eager to turn one set of words into
        | another set of words to get CodeCombat as accessible across the world as possible.
        | If you like getting sneak peeks at upcoming content and getting these levels to
        | your fellow nationals ASAP, then this class might be for you.
