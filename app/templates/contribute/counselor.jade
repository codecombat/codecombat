      p Do you have life experience?
        | A different perspective on things that can help us decide how to shape CodeCombat?
        | Of all these roles, this will probably take the least time, but
        | individually you may make the most difference.
        | We're on the lookout for wisened sages, particularly in areas like: teaching,
        | game development, open source project management, technical recruiting, entrepreneurship,
        | or design.
      
      p Or really anything that is relevant to the development of CodeCombat.
        | If you have knowledge and want to share it to help grow this project, then
        | this class might be for you.
