      h2 CodeCombat for Teachers

      p.lead Want to use CodeCombat in your classroom? Great!

      p It's free, there's no signup required, and we're excited to hear what your students think.

      p You should be able to just point your kids at the site and let them play--you don't need to introduce it or cover anything about programming in advance. However, we've made the game pretty hard, because it's a multiplayer game, and players should be able to team up to help each other when they get stuck.

      p In a classroom setting, multiplayer is easy: just do pair programming, with two students playing together at one computer taking turns typing. (We also have real-time multiplayer built into the game, but there's no need to use that when you're right next to each other in a classroom.)

      p More questions? Get in touch! Feature requests? We'd love to hear them! CodeCombat is new and needs to hear from you to learn what teachers would love to have in their classrooms of programming wizards-to-be.
