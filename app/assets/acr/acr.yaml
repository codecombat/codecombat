                All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text
                alternative that serves the equivalent purpose. Ozaria includes
                a screen reader mode that features full WCAG 2.0 AAA
                compatibility, and all Ozaria content has been made playable for
                screen reader users. When playing Ozaria using screen reader,
                text descriptions provide descriptive identification of the
                non-text content, aiding in the sensory experience of the game.
                Accompanying this, a smooth game navigation system with a
                keyboard-and-narrated-text overlay has been developed.
                Additionally, an automatic video subtitle display and cinematic
                keyboard navigation has been integrated into the game for
                further accessibility options.

                The CodeCombat and Ozaria platforms contain minimal prerecorded
                media content. Where audio content exists, such as in-game
                dialogue voiceovers, it is always accompanied by text
                transcriptions. Any video-only content is supplemented with text
                descriptions or audio narration. The game's core educational
                content and gameplay mechanics are primarily delivered through
                interactive elements with multiple modes of accessibility,
                ensuring that any media content is supplementary rather than
                essential to the learning experience.

                Curriculum materials very occasionally include standalone audio
                or video content. When such content is included, it is always
                accompanied by text transcriptions for audio-only content and
                descriptive text or narration for video-only content. The
                primary instructional content is text-based, with any media
                serving as optional supplementary material.

                Outside of the game, the CodeCombat and Ozaria platforms ensure
                that all information, structure, and relationships conveyed
                through visual presentation are programmatically determinable or
                available as text. The platforms use semantic HTML markup, ARIA
                landmarks, and proper heading structures throughout. Form
                elements are properly labeled and grouped, and data tables
                include appropriate headers and relationships. Inside of the
                game, the screen reader support in Ozaria ensures all structural
                relationships are preserved and communicated effectively.

                Headers, lists, tables, and other structural elements are
                implemented using appropriate formatting that can be
                programmatically determined by assistive technologies.

                Content in both CodeCombat and Ozaria follows a logical reading
                sequence that preserves meaning when rendered by assistive
                technologies. The DOM order matches the visual presentation,
                ensuring that screen readers present content in a logical and
                understandable sequence. In Ozaria, navigation through game
                elements and educational content maintains a meaningful order
                that preserves context and relationships.

                size, visual location, orientation, or sound. Narrated
                instructions are provided with accompanying text display.
                Furthermore, in Ozaria, for example, there is in-game textual
                identification of visual items like "lever" and "switch" when
                these are important for progression in the game.

                References to content elements include textual descriptions

                Visual elements are accompanied by descriptive text that doesn't
                require sensory perception to understand.

                CodeCombat and Ozaria do not use color as the only visual means
                of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a
                response, or distinguishing a visual element. Components such as
                shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, and sound are
                used in combination to indicate how a user should proceed. For
                example, in CodeCombat when a user has successfully completed a
                level, the user is prompted to click on a green, rectangular
                button with "Done" text. There is an animated, pulsing glow to
                the button once a user should click on it. There is also an
                animated, yellow arrow that appears below this button that
                attracts the user's attention to it. Voice narration instructs a
                user to click the button.

                All curriculum materials ensure that color is never the sole

                instructions are conveyed through multiple visual and textual
                indicators. When color coding is used, it is always accompanied
                by text labels, patterns, or other visual indicators to ensure
                the information is accessible to all users.

                CodeCombat and Ozaria provide full keyboard accessibility for

                enter code in the editor, interact with game controls, and
                access all educational content using only a keyboard interface.
                No functionality requires specific timing for keystrokes. The
                code editor and game interface are fully operable through
                keyboard commands, allowing users to write code, execute it, and

                * Can be disabled through user preferences

                accidental activation

                * Are only active when the relevant component has keyboard focus

                CodeCombat and Ozaria are designed to be navigated sequentially,
                with in-game levels that increase in difficulty and coding
                concepts taught to users. Both have an in-game map that shows
                the progression of the levels, with focus given to the level
                that a user should begin next according to the game sequence. In
                CodeCombat for example, visual elements like a flag illustration
                indicates which level they should begin next and a floating,
                pulsating arrow appears to encourage a user to click on the
                level to begin. Completed levels are marked on the map with a
                small, circular icon. These elements are all navigable with the
                tab key in the intended order.

                Both platforms implement pointer interactions following

                After clicking the "RUN" button, the in-game code editors of
                CodeCombat and Ozaria automatically detect input errors from the
                user and provide hints for how the user can correct the error.
                The code that is in error is identified and the error is
                described to the user in text. In CodeCombat for example, when
                an error is detected the line of code that contains the error is
                highlighted in color and a pop-up window appears titled "Fix
                Your Code" with textual hints for correcting the mistake.

                correct the error. The code that is in error is identified and
                the error is described to the user in text. In CodeCombat for
                example, when an error is detected the line of code that

                platforms are implemented with appropriate ARIA landmarks,

                clearly identified and their purposes are programmatically
                discoverable.

                the page indicates the course and specific level within that
                course.


                Users can always determine their location within the platforms

                Content throughout both platforms is organized using clear
                section headings that:


                * Follow logical hierarchy (h1-h6)

                * Accurately describe section content

                * Aid in navigation and content structure

                * Provide clear organization for educational content


                All major sections, lessons, and content areas use appropriate
                heading structure.


                As an example of how CodeCombat and Ozaria both use section
                headings to organize the content, in-game levels have titles
                that appear at the top of the page indicating the course and
                level. When playing the second level in CodeCombat, for example,
                a header at the top reads "Introduction to Computer Science" and
                a subheader reads "2. Gems in the Deep." The "Introduction to
                Computer Science" header is consistent for each level, while the
                subheader is updated with specific information about the current
                level. When playing the third level, the subheader changes to
                read "3. Shadow Guard".

                Curriculum materials use consistent heading structures to
                organize content, with clear hierarchical relationships between
                sections and subsections. All content is properly sectioned with
                descriptive headers that aid in navigation and comprehension.
                Section headings are used to organize the content in the
                curricular materials. For example, page 1 of CodeCombat lesson
                plans are organized into the following sections: Learning
                Objectives, Student Goals, Play Levels, Overview, Agenda,
                Resources, and Preparation. Furthermore, section headings are
                used consistently throughout the lesson slides for both
                platforms.

                Interactive elements throughout both platforms are designed with
                accessibility in mind:


                * Primary navigation buttons meet the 44x44 CSS pixel minimum
                size

                * Game controls are sized for easy interaction

                * Menu items and important interface elements maintain
                comfortable target sizes

                * Where smaller targets exist, equivalent larger targets are
                provided


                Essential elements like code editor interface components may use
                standard size conventions where necessary.

                CodeCombat and Ozaria provide features making the use by
                individuals with limited cognitive, language, and learning
                abilities simpler and easier. All non-text content that is
                presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the
                equivalent purpose. Ozaria includes a screen reader
                compatibility overlay that features full WCAG 2.0 AAA
                compatibility, and all Ozaria content has been made playable for
                screen reader users. When playing Ozaria using screen reader,
                text descriptions provide descriptive identification of the
                non-text content, aiding in the sensory experience of the game.
                Accompanying this, a smooth game navigation system with a
                keyboard-and-narrated-text overlay has been developed.
                Additionally, an automatic video subtitle display and cinematic
                keyboard navigation has been integrated into the game for
                further accessibility options.


                For both Ozaria and CodeCombat, users can take as much time and
                tries as they need to complete a level. Users click the "Done"
                button when they are ready to proceed. The in-game visual field
                can be made larger to ease in readability by clicking the
                magnifying glass icon and can also be made full screen. The
                "Hints" and "Code Bank" features provide additional support for
                users with limited language, cognitive, and learning abilities.
