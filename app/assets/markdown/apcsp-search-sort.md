# Searching and Sorting

### Learning Objectives
- [LO 4.2.1] Explain the difference between algorithms that run in a reasonable time and those that do not run in a reasonable time. [P1]
- [LO 4.2.4] Evaluate algorithms analytically and empirically for efficiency, correctness, and clarity. [P4]

This unit takes a look at some classic algorithms that come up time and again: searching and sorting. These are good examples of algorithms that can be analyzed for effectiveness and performance.

## Search Algorithms
The teacher will start by explaining how there are often many different solutions to problems, and part of the task of a programmer is coming up with and weighing the pros and cons of each solution, and also making sure they’ll work in all cases. One of the most common tasks computers have is taking a large body of data and finding things. In real life:

When you sign into a service, the system looks up your information based on your username or email, which could be among thousands or millions of other users.

Search engines are hugely complex systems which take arbitrary words and find relevant results, and can also filter for specific things like when creation date, tags or popularity.

Sometimes results are fuzzy, or unique to the user. For example, Facebook, Pinterest, Netflix, Spotify, Amazon and other services will find content or items that you may find interesting based on things you’ve chosen before.

In video games, computer players are often searching for the “best path” to take to get to a certain location.

For this unit, the class will brainstorm, analyze, and perform a search algorithm using real-life dictionaries. Have students come up with possible steps for finding an arbitrary word within a dictionary. Each solution must be specific about what steps are taken, so “turn the page” or “open the book one third of the way in” as opposed to “flip through until you see the right letter”. For each solution, have students evaluate:

Will it work? Will the correct answer (what page the word is on) always be found?
How quickly will it go? Evaluate based on the expected number of steps, and compared to other solutions.

**Here are some example algorithms that may be discussed and compared:**

- **Linear search**: Start at the first page and flip through until you find the word.
- **Linear search from either end**: if the word is before “N”, start at the beginning, otherwise start at the end. Then flip through each page until you find the word.
- **Random search**: Pick a random page. Check if the word is there. Repeat. (special note here, this will eventually work, but only if the word is in the dictionary, otherwise this algorithm could run forever)
- **Tabbed search**: Use the letter indicators on the side of the dictionary (or add tabs if there are none) to start from, then do linear search.
- **Binary search**: Open to the middle of the book. Determine which half of the book the word is in. Take that half, look at its center point, and repeat until you find the word.

Be sure to talk about at least linear and binary searches. As an activity, give a few students dictionaries and have them “run” searches with some of the algorithms discussed. They can be raced with each other, either in real time, or one page turn at a time. It should be pretty clear that the binary search is the winner.

Another thing to consider is other things that can be searched for. A verb that starts with “T”. An adjective with at least two “g’s”. What algorithms would work for these searches? It seems that the linear search is the most flexible search, even if it’s not the most efficient.

Once this activity is done, segue to sorting algorithms by asking students what sorts of algorithms they can use to find words if the dictionary is not in order. Consider how many of the algorithms they considered would not work with a shuffled dictionary. Often it makes sense to take unorganized data and make it organized so that searches can be done efficiently, which leads to the other classic set of algorithms:

## Sorting Algorithms
Here’s a common problem: You have a bunch of things in a list, but they’re not in order. This can make finding the one you want much harder, among other things. There are a lot of ways people use computers to sort information like this. Some are much faster than others.

One simple but very slow example is Bubble Sort. This algorithm works by going through the list from left to right, comparing adjacent pairs of values. If the pair is out of order relative to each other, they get swapped; otherwise they’re left alone. If you do this N times for an N-long list, you get a sorted list!
Q: About how many comparisons does this algorithm make? (A: N^2 — N for each time you go through the list. If your list is 1000 elements, that means 1,000,000 comparisons!)

If you try doing this yourself, you’ll see that it goes very slowly. Let’s compare it to better sorting algorithm, Radix Sort. With a list of numbers, Radix Sort works by first sorting by just the highest digit, then within each bucket sorting by the next highest digit, down until you sort by the 1s place.
Q: About how many comparisons does this algorithm make? (A: Just N*W, for N numbers with W digits each. So for sorting a list of 1000 4-digit numbers, it would only take 4000 comparisons)

There are other ways we could sort a list that are much slower. Let’s take Bogo Sort as an example. In Bogo Sort, you first check if the list is sorted. If it isn’t, randomize the order. Repeat until the list is sorted. This will not finish in a reasonable amount of time. In fact, this could take an almost infinite amount of time.

Most ways to sort lists work in a reasonable amount of time, even if they’re slower than others (with the exception of things like Bogo Sort). But for some problems, even the best algorithms are very, very slow. One classic example is the Traveling Salesman problem, where you must find the fastest path that travels through all of a set of points on a map, which can take more than 2^N steps for N points. So 1000 points would take a number of steps too large to type into this page!

The way around that is to find algorithms that can find a good solution, but not necessarily the best solution. By loosening that requirement, we can get much faster results. These methods tend to involve “heuristic functions”, which approximate some part of the algorithm.

### Activity

Line the students up in random order, and sort them by birthday. You can start with bubble sort to show that it’s quite slow, then start over and try radix sort.

Instructions for bubble sorting students:
- Starting at the left side, point to the two students at the end, and have them say their birthdays.
 - If the one on the left is later than the one on the right, have them swap positions.
 - Move one student to the right (eg from positions 1 and 2 to positions 2 and 3)
 - Repeat until you get to the right side of the list
- Repeat the above once for each student in your class (or until you decide you've demonstrated it enough — it's pretty slow!)

Instructions for radix sorting students:
- First, identify what years students were born in. Separate them out into one group per year.
- In each year group, separate them out into one bucket for each month of that year.
- In each month group, separate them out into three buckets — one for 1-10, one for 11-20, and one for 21-31
- In each of those buckets, separate them out by the exact day of the month.
- While doing this, keep all the groups in order. At the end, the class should be sorted!

### Discussion Questions:
- For two algorithms, how fast are they comparatively? How else can they be compared?
- For a given algorithm, will it always work? Even in the case where the thing being looked at isn’t in the collection? How can you be sure?
