### Learning Objectives:

- [LO 1.1.1] Apply a creative development process when creating computational artifacts. [P2]
- [LO 1.2.2] Create a computational artifact using computing tools and techniques to solve a problem. [P2]
- [LO 1.2.3] Create a new computational artifact by combining or modifying existing artifacts. [P2]
- [LO 1.2.4] Collaborate in the creation of computational artifacts. [P6]
- [LO 3.1.1] Find patterns and test hypotheses about digitally processed information to gain insight and knowledge. [P4]
- [LO 3.1.2] Collaborate when processing information to gain insight and knowledge. [P6]
- [LO 3.1.3] Explain the insight and knowledge gained from digitally processed data by using appropriate visualizations, notations, and precise language. [P5]
- [LO 3.2.1] Extract information from data to discover and explain connections or trends. [P1]

### What is the Data Project?
 
The data project is a multiple day in-class partner assignment. Students will work in pairs to investigate a dataset of interest. They will apply what they learned throughout the unit to create a website displaying information about the data.
 
### What you need:
- Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets
- CodeCombat 
- Publicly available data, such as fivethirtyeight.com or Google Trends
 
Students will work with a partner to answer a question of interest. They will first make a hypothesis then use publicly available datasets to answer the question. The students will extract information from the data, create data visualizations, process the information, and make conclusions. Finally, the students will create a webpage on CodeCombat that shows their findings. 

This project should take four class periods - one to plan the project and locate data, one to extract information and create visualizations, one to process the information and make conclusions, and one to create the webpage.
 
### Discussion Questions:
- How did you decide on the layout and visualizations for your website? How do your design decisions showcase the data?
- How did your partner help you gain additional insight from the data?
- How did your hypothesis compare to your findings?
