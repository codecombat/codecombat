##### Getting Started
# Start Using Ozaria in 10 Minutes!
#### Help your class enter the world of Ozaria with these steps.

##### STEP 1
## Create a Teacher Account

After you’ve created your Teacher account, you will be able to create classes, invite students, monitor students’ progress, enroll students, and assign unit content once students have been enrolled.

Select the **Create Teacher Account** option during account creation in order to sign up as a teacher.

<img src="/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/getting-started/teacher-account-ozaria.png" title="Create a Teacher Account" alt="create-teacher-account-modal"/>

Once your teacher account is setup, you’ll be able to access your [Teacher Dashboard](/teachers/classes).

### What if I already have an account?

If you would like to login with an existing CodeCombat username, email address or Google Sign-in you can. However, classrooms are specific to each program so you will need to create a new class on Ozaria and invite your students to it.

### What are the technical requirements for Ozaria?
Ozaria runs best on computers with at least 4GB of RAM, on a modern browser such as Chrome, Safari,  Firefox, or Edge. Chromebooks with less RAM may have minor graphics issues in later units. A minimum of 200 Kbps bandwidth per student is required, although 1+ Mbps is recommended.


*We do not currently support iPads or Android Tablets at this time.*

##### STEP 2
## Create a New Class

Once logged in, or if you click the Teacher link in the navigation bar, you’ll see your new [Teacher Dashboard](/teachers/classes). From here, you’ll be able to create classes and monitor your student’s progress.

Click the “Create a New Class” button on the teacher dashboard, then choose a class name that will help you and your students identify the class, such as “Mr. Smith 3rd period.”

<img src="/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/getting-started/create-new-class-modal.png" title="Create a New Class" alt="create-new-class-modal" width="400px" />

If you signed up with Google, you can now link your Google Classrooms to Ozaria. To do so:
- Click “Create a Class.”
- Click “Link Google Classroom” & accept permissions.
- Finish class creation by selecting a programming language (JavaScript or Python).

You’re done! Students now have accounts and can sign in using Google single sign-on (SSO).
That’s it! You can now add students in less than a minute!

*If you previously linked a Google Classroom to CodeCombat, you will not be able to link the same classroom to Ozaria at this time. For more information, please reach out to [support@ozaria.com](support@ozaria.com).*


### Should I choose Python or JavaScript?
We recommend Python, because it’s both beginner-friendly and currently used by major corporations (such as Google). It is a popular programming language used in Data Science among other growing tech fields like Machine learning. If you have younger or first-time learners, we strongly recommend Python.


JavaScript will work great too. It’s the language of the web; used across every website, and still beginner-friendly.  If you are planning to also teach web development, you may prefer to choose JavaScript. We’ve also made it easy for students to transition from Python to JavaScript-based web development. JavaScript’s syntax is a little more difficult for beginners than Python.

##### STEP 3
## Add Students
Once you’ve created your class, you’ll see it under the list of Current Classes. Navigate the class where you want to add students, then choose one of three ways to add students; two of which are outlined below: *Invite Students via Email or Class Code*

<img src="/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/getting-started/add-students-ozaria.png" title="Add Students" alt="add-students" width="400px"/>
_Use your unique class code, class URL or invite students via email._


### Option 1: Invite Students via Email
*Easiest option if your students have email addresses*
On the Teacher Dashboard, under “My Classes”, click the "Invite Students by Email" button, then enter your students’ email addresses (you can copy and paste this from your class list or student information system) and click "Invite Students". Students will receive an email instructing them to follow a link, which will allow them to create an account and join your class.

Make sure they are creating a **Student Account** and that the correct class name is displayed when they create their account.

<img src="/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/getting-started/test-class-ozaria.png" title="Create a Student Account" alt="create-student-account" width="400px"/>
_Students should see your class name in place of "My Ozaria Class"._

Students will need to enter the following to create a Student Account:
- First name
- Last initial
- Username (help them choose an appropriate unique username)
- Password

Email addresses are _not required_ for students creating an account when they have a valid Class Code from you. That said, using an email address is recommended if they have one, for easier password recovery.

*Students can also use an existing CodeCombat.com account to login into Ozaria.com*. When inviting students via email just remember to enter the email they currently use for CodeCombat.

*If your school uses Google Apps for Education*, students can connect using the "Sign in with Google" button when they click "Login" at the top of the screen instead of manually entering their information. They can then sign in to Ozaria using the G+ Connect button in the future.

After students have created their account, they are shown their username and instructed to write down this information.

That’s it! Students can now use their login credentials to start playing CodeCombat!

### Option 2: Students Join via a Class Code
*Easiest option if you students don’t have email addresses*

Direct your students to [Ozaria](https://ozaria.com) and have them click on the “I’m a Student” button on the center of the screen. Students can also click “Sign Up” on the top navigation bar and then select the "Sign up as a Student" button.

<img src="/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/getting-started/student-account-ozaria.png" title="Create a Student Account" alt="create-student-account" width="400px"/>
_Make sure your students click “Sign up as a Student” when prompted._

The website will request the “Class Code” for your class, which can be found if you click “View Class” on your  Teacher Dashboard. Your classroom will have its own unique three-word code.

<img src="/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/getting-started/class-code-example.png" title="Class Code Example" alt="class-code-example" width="400px"/>
_How to find your Class Code as a Teacher: Click on one of your classes, and look for the three-word Class Code next under “Adding Students”._

Once students enter your Class Code, they should see the correct class name and instructor on the screen.

Students will need to enter the following to create a Student Account:
- First name
- Last initial
- Username (help them choose an appropriate unique username)
- Password

Email addresses are _not required_ for students creating an account when they have a valid Class Code from you. That said, using an email address is recommended if they have one, for easier password recovery.

*Students can also use an existing CodeCombat.com account to login into Ozaria.com*.

*If your school uses Google Apps for Education*, students can connect using the "Sign in with Google" button when they click “Login” at the top of the screen instead of manually entering their information. They can then sign in to Ozaria using the "Sign in with Google" button in the future.

After students have created their account, they are shown their username and instructed to write down this information.

That’s it! Students can now use their login credentials to start playing Ozaria!

##### STEP 4
## Chapter 1: Up The Mountain

All students are automatically granted access to the first unit for free in Ozaria, *Chapter 1: Up The Mountain*. This is a unit that introduces students to concepts such as basic syntax, variables, and while loops. This unit contains about 1-2 hours of content depending on the age and experience level of the class. The first chapter/unit and all subsequent chapters will contain around 7-8 hours of content.

<img src="/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/getting-started/unit-guides.png" title="Unit Guides" alt="unit-guides" width="400px"/>
_Unit Guides allow you to preview unit levels and view solutions._

As a teacher, you can access solutions for each unit by going to [Unit Guides](/teachers/units/) (located on the teacher dashboard). You can also preview every level using the dropdown selectors.

<img src="/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/getting-started/resource-hub-ozaria.png" title="Resource Hub" alt="resource-hub" width="400px"/>
_Unit Guides allow you to preview unit levels and view solutions._

If you're new to teaching computer science, we also recommend taking a look at the [Resource Hub](/teachers/resources), where you can find lesson plans, worksheets and supplemental guides to help you kickstart your classroom.

##### STEP 5
## Tracking Progress

<img src="/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/getting-started/student-overview-ozaria.png" title="Student Overview" alt="student-overview" width="400px"/>
_A high-level view of student progress in each unit is displayed in the main class view._

After students join the class, you’ll see their progress appear in the individual classroom pages. Any assigned unit and each student’s progress in each unit (starting with Chapter 1: Up The Mountain and onwards) is represented by a colored circle. A grey circle means a student has not begun any levels in that unit, yellow circle means they have started working on the unit's levels, and a green circle means that they’ve completed all of the levels in the unit.

<img src="/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/getting-started/student-progress-ozaria.png" title="Student Progress" alt="student-progress" width="400px"/>
_Navigate to the "Unit Progress" tab to view more detailed information of student progress within each unit._

If you want to see how your students are doing within a unit, click on the "Unit Progress” tab. You’ll be able to view how much progress a student has made in a specific unit. A gray circle means a level has not been started, a yellow circle indicates a level has been started but not completed, and a green circle means a level has been completed. By moving your mouse pointer over the circle for a level, you can see information about when they completed the level, as well as a rough estimate of how long the level took to complete.

##### STEP 6
