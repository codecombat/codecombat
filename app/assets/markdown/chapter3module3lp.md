# Chapter 3: Module 3 Lesson Plan

# Overview

**Learning Objectives**

   - Nest conditionals within loops.
   - Use nested structures to accomplish a given task.

**Standards**

This module was designed to align to the following standards:

   - CSTA Standards
       - 1A-AP-10: Develop programs with sequences and simple loops, to express ideas or address a problem.
       - 1B-AP-10: Create programs that include sequences, events, loops, and conditionals.
       - 2-AP-12: Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals.

# Materials

- Teacher Guide to Systems (coming soon)
    - See the Chapter 1 Lesson Plan for an explanation of important in-game student supports.
- Solutions: To view solutions for levels, navigate to the Unit Guides tab and click on the &quot;Level Overviews and Solutions&quot; link under Chapter 3. From there, the Module 3 solutions start at &quot;For Mouse.&quot;

# Content Background

- Key Terms
    - **Nesting:** Placing one programming construct inside of another.
      - **Nested for loop**: When a for loop is placed inside of another structure (for example another for loop).
      - **Nested conditional**: When a conditional is placed inside of another structure (for example a for loop).
- Explanation of instructional pathway
    - The third module of Chapter 3 introduces nested structures. This comes before a module about while loops and after the module introducing for loops.

# **Narrative Background**

The hero and Mouse get caught up in a Time Storm, and Mouse is lost! The hero spends this module working with Octans to learn nesting, attempting to work their way through puzzles in order to get Mouse back.

# Instructional Tips

**Common Student Misconceptions**

- Students may struggle with indentation and understanding the flow of control.
    - When nesting loops or conditionals, indentation (especially in Python) and brackets (in JavaScript) become essential. These tell students which parts of the code different statements belong to. If students are struggling with where to put different pieces, have them write the code out on paper and circle the inner structure and outer structure. Then, they should translate that into code to complete a level.

**Differentiation**

- Have students who finish early look up while loops, which will be covered in Module 4. Have them write down the similarities and differences between while and for loops based on their research.
- Have students who are struggling break up the challenges, especially for nested for loops. They should identify the inner patterns before they identify how many times the inner pattern happens.
