# Algorithms - Hitchhiker's Guide
 
### AP Computer Science Principles: Learning Objectives
- [LO 4.1.2] Express an algorithm in a language. [P5]
- [LO 4.2.2] Explain the difference between solvable and unsolvable problems in computer science. [P1]
- [LO 4.2.3] Explain the existence of undecidable problems in computer science. [P1]
 
What are unsolvable and undecidable problems?
 
## What you need:
- [Video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboZctrHfK8)
- [Halting Problem article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-describing-alan-turings-halting-problem-to_us_58d1ae08e4b062043ad4add7)
 
Students will watch a video clip from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. After watching the clip, they will break into small groups and discuss the clip. In particular, they will focus on the problem the computer was attempting to solve - what is the answer to life, the universe, and everything. They will work together to try and determine an algorithm that could solve that problem then share the algorithm with the class. A whole-class discussion on unsolvable and undecidable problems will follow. The discussion will include an introduction to the Halting Problem, guiding students to see that it is undecidable. LO 4.1.2[P5], LO 4.2.2[P1], LO 4.2.3[P1]
 
 
### Discussion Questions:
- What makes a problem unsolvable?
- What makes a problem undecidable?
- Does it surprise you that computers cannot solve everything?
