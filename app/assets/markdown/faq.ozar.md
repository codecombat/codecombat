### What is Ozaria?
Ozaria is the new adventure game from the makers of CodeCombat, built for students to master computer science concepts through immersive gameplay, an epic story, and creative capstones.

### How is Ozaria related to CodeCombat?
Over the last five years, over twelve million people have learned to write Python and JavaScript using CodeCombat, making it one of the most popular coding games in history. Now, we are excited to launch Ozaria and expand on our commitment to inspire a new generation of students to learn computer science.

Ozaria is more story-driven than CodeCombat, as each learner customizes their own hero and finds that only through mastering the lost magic of coding can they save the world of Ozaria from impending darkness. The unfolding narrative creates a powerful student-centered learning experience, with each student’s investment in Ozaria’s story paralleling the investment they are making in their own learning journey.

### Why the change to Ozaria?
When CodeCombat first launched five years ago, the demand for computer science was in its infancy - most schools just needed one hour of code! Thanks to sustained advocacy of computer science educators and organizations, progressive school leaders, and new state requirements, much has changed since the early days. We wanted to be proactive in building a product that can be used over the long run, as computer science curriculum needs continue to evolve. We see Ozaria as the evolution of CodeCombat and our goals to expand computer science access and inspire the next generation of students to build a connection to the creativity and imagination inherent in computer science.

### Does Ozaria have a storyline?
Yes! Ozaria is a story-driven game - because storytelling is at the nexus of human emotion, imagination, and information sharing. When students customize their hero in Ozaria, they enter a vast world filled with the echoes of many rulers, kingdoms, and a history rich with myths of ancient magic and the legend of a darkness long defeated.

The Hero lives in a small and peaceful town named River’s End with their mother, Astra, and a dog named Mouse. Soon, something begins to change as winters become longer and crops start to die. The Hero awakens to find their mother has disappeared, leaving only a letter and map to the Sky Mountains. Now with the help of Vega, Mouse, and an ancient device called the Acodus, students will discover that only through the lost magic of coding and the development of their programming skills can they trap the darkness and save their world.

### Can I use my CodeCombat login on Ozaria.com or do I have to sign up for a new account?
Yes, you can use the same username, email address or Google Sign-in to sign into both CodeCombat and Ozaria. However, classrooms are specific to each program; if you've created a classroom for your students in CodeCombat, you'll need to create a separate classroom in Ozaria and invite them to that as well. Your students can use their existing account details to log into Ozaria.com.

### How do I transition back to CodeCombat?
You have a few options when transitioning back to CodeCombat, depending on how you would like to structure your class. These include exploring computer science concepts in more depth, practicing more with game development, and introducing students to web development. You can read more about these options in the [Ozaria Implementation Options](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Py8lBN3uGjrvsHdm_2wnO7T0wLPYEW0PCJ7XsMVHEYo/edit?usp=sharing).

### Will there be repeated material when I transition back to CodeCombat?
Fundamental programming concepts that are introduced in Ozaria will be used in CodeCombat, including variables, conditionals, and debugging. Students will be able to practice and expand on these skills with CodeCombat levels that vary in design and gameplay from Ozaria levels.

### How much Ozaria content is there?
We estimate that the in-game and lesson slide content for Chapter 1: Sky Mountain (free unit) can take up to 10 class sessions* and Chapters 1-4 can take up to 85 class sessions. However, we've developed our content so that that it's flexible so that you can adjust the duration of Ozaria to fit your classroom's needs. For example, here is a [pacing guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EbWMXI1-0697csaM_NCZLUWvJKed5ayFGlC73I7rztk/edit#gid=0) that breaks up Ozaria content into weeks. 

*We approximate one class session as a standard 50 minute class. You can also find more time estimates in the Curriculum Guide section of your teacher dashboard.

### What ages or grades are appropriate for Ozaria?
Ozaria, like CodeCombat, is recommended for middle and high schools, or elementary students in 4th or 5th grade.

### How do I get started with Ozaria?
To get started:
1. Create your Teacher Account
2. Create a class.
3. Invite your students to the classroom by clicking Link Google Classroom, sending them the Class URL or Class Code.
4. Sit back and watch your students have fun learning to code.

Please refer to [Teacher Getting Started Guide](/teachers/resources/getting-started) for instructions on each step .

### Does Ozaria work on an iPad?
We do not currently support iPads or Android Tablets at this time.

### Is there a recommended browser and operating system?
Ozaria runs best on computers with at least 4GB of RAM, on a modern browser such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge. Chromebooks with 2GB of RAM may have minor graphics issues in later units. A minimum of 200 Kbps bandwidth per student is required, although 1+ Mbps is recommended.

### Is there any built-in chat option where students can communicate with one another?
No.

### What programming languages are available?
We currently support Python and JavaScript.

**Why should you choose Python?** Python is both beginner-friendly and currently used by major corporations (such as Google). It is a popular programming language used in Data Science among other growing tech fields like Machine Learning. If you have younger or first-time learners, we strongly recommend Python.

**Why should you choose JavaScript?** JavaScript is the language of the web and is used across nearly every website. You may prefer to choose JavaScript if you are planning to also study web development. We’ve also made it easy for students to transition from Python to JavaScript-based web development.
JavaScript’s syntax is a little more difficult for beginners than Python, so if you cannot decide between the two, we recommend Python.

### Can I use Ozaria as the class’s main curriculum?
Absolutely! Ozaria's in-game content and lesson slides meet every middle school Computer Science Teacher Association (CSTA) standard. Built by educators, our turnkey tools and resources are comprehensive so that educators can use Ozaria without any prior computer science experience themselves. We've also included distance learning strategies and ensured that all of our lesson slide activities can be completed via distance learning.

Each chapter and module comes with [lesson slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KgFOg2tqbKEH8qNwIBdmK2QbHvTsxnW_Xo7LvjPsxwE/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use to guide students through their Ozaria journey while showcasing real-world connections. There are also additional curriculum resources in our [Resource Hub](/teachers/resources), which includes best practices for implementation, pacing guides, standards alignment, and tutorials. Last but not least, we provide solutions for every chapter so teachers can help spot and correct errors in student work as they come up.

### What sort of teacher support will be provided in Ozaria?
Teachers will have lesson plans similar to the curriculum guides for CodeCombat, with less focus on specific concept activities, since students will be learning most of the content inside the game itself. We also aim to create supplemental materials like PowerPoints and additional guides sometime after initial launch.

### Is there a limit to how many students I can add in the free trial unit?
No.

### Can my students create an account if they have no email address?
Yes - students signing up with a Class Code or a Class URL are given the option to choose a Username and skip the email field (it's labeled as "Optional"). Please refer to [Teacher Getting Started Guide](/teachers/resources/getting-started) more information about adding students to your class.

### Does Ozaria have projects that students can work on and share?
Ozaria will have sharing options similar to CodeCombat’s game development and web development projects. In Ozaria, when students are finished building their Capstone Projects, they will be given a link to post their work to their classroom and to share with friends/family.

### How do I reset my student's password?
As an instructor, you can reset the password for any students who have not verified their email address (or if they haven't provided an email address). To do so, go to that student's class, find the student in the list of students, and click "Edit" on the right side of the student's row.
If your student has verified their email, they will need to use the 'Forgot your password?' link in the Log In pop-up to reset their password.

### What is the difference between the Interactives and Capstones Levels?

**Interactives**
These are the formative checks for student knowledge presented in a 'multiple-choice' or 'fill in' format that **introduce new concepts** in a scaffolded way. Interactives will accompany Cinematics (expositional dialog that introduces concepts in an engaging way) and work to reinforce the concept(s) introduced.

**Capstone Levels**
Each Ozaria unit/chapter will also conclude with an opportunity for students to create their own project. Since these opportunities will now be built into every chapter, we anticipate that they will do a much better job of demonstrating to students the real-world opportunities that computer science can open up for them. Capstone projects will feature more structural support in the form of the in-game helper and Intros, which will guide the students through high-level steps to complete each project.

### Will there be Challenge Levels?
Challenge levels are introduced in Chapter 2: The Moon Dancers and used throughout all subsequent chapters.

There may be multiple solutions to a given challenge level, but they will be evaluated based on:

1. Completing the game goals
2. Including any required game constructs

Challenge levels will communicate to teachers how individual students did on given topics and how best to give feedback based on those topics. For example, if a challenge level assesses if statements, the challenge level might break down into three key skills:

1. Writing an if/else conditional with proper syntax
2. Choosing the correct condition to test
3. Meeting all goals of the level

The teacher will receive feedback on whether students reached some or all of these goals.

### How do I assess my students’ grasp of concepts?
In Ozaria, students are presented with introductory content and then their understanding is checked through frequent formative assessment activities that they will have to complete before moving onto the level. The teacher dashboard lets you check each student's performance on these concept checks including the number of attempts to get to the correct answer.

The lesson slides also contain unplugged coding concept checks and project-based assessments that you can use via whole classroom, small group, or distance learning instruction.

As students develop mastery in specific coding concepts, they complete open-ended challenge levels where they can apply their knowledge. Challenge levels are found in Chapter 2: The Moon Dancers and all subsequent chapters (there are no challenge levels in Chapter 1: Sky Mountain). The teacher dashboard then lets you compare each student's solution against a suggested solution to help you evaluate their coding abilities.

Additionally, there is one Capstone coding project at the end of every chapter, where students create their own game. We provide evaluation rubrics so that you can use Capstone projects as your primary summative assessments.

### Can students skip earlier levels if they already understand the concepts?
No. We strongly encourage that all students play every level even if they already know the concepts, so that they can reinforce their knowledge. The levels are carefully planned out to build confidence and progress student’s knowledge of core concepts in a scaffolded way that prepares them for harder, more advanced units.

Educators can assign units/chapters at their discretion, but we recommend that your students work through chapters in the suggested order.

### How will students be able to reflect on what happened in the level after they’ve completed it?
Students will be able to reflect on newly learned concepts via Cinematics and Interactives. A summary Cinematic will help remind them of what they've learned, and then they will practice that concept within the levels.

### How do I review my students’ level code?
Teachers can compare each student’s level code to the Ozaria suggested solution code by navigating to the Unit Progress tab in their classroom and clicking on any of their students’ green (level completed) or yellow (level in-progress) progress dots.

### Where can I find the solutions to all levels?
Solutions to each level can be found in the [Unit Guides](/teachers/units) page -- to view the solutions, navigate to a unit, then click the Level Solutions guide for either JavaScript or Python.

All teachers have access to solutions for Chapter 1: Sky Mountain. Teachers who have paid student licenses have access to solutions for all chapters.

### How much does it cost to access all of the available units and resources?
We customize solutions for schools and districts and work with you to understand your use case, context, and budget. Contact schools@ozaria.com for further details!

### Does the teacher need to purchase a license if they want to work through the levels like their students?
No. Teachers can preview and play all game levels by going to the [Unit Guides](/teachers/units) page and selecting a level from the dropdown menus.

### What does a license provide?
A license provides a single student access to the entire curriculum beyond the free unit, which is Chapter 1: Sky Mountain. For students starting out in Ozaria, once Chapter 1 is complete, a license will grant access to the next available chapters and all paid CodeCombat content. As we continue to develop more of Ozaria, it will become the primary content for classrooms that start with Chapter 1: Sky Mountain.

### Do you have any free units for educators to try before they make their purchasing decision?
Yes! We have a free course in CodeCombat and a free chapter in Ozaria. 
**Ozaria - Chapter 1: The Sky Mountain** is free and does not require student licenses. It takes 1-2 hours depending on your students' ages and prior experience. The including lesson slides lets you extend your students' experience and can take up to 10 class sessions*, using unplugged activities and exploration projects.

**CodeCombat** - Our **Introduction to Computer Science** course does not require a purchase. It contains 44 levels and takes 1-3 hours depending on your students' ages and experience. 

*We approximate one class session as a standard 50 minute class. You can also find more time estimates in the Curriculum Guide section of your teacher dashboard.

There is no limit to the amount of students who can participate!
Please feel free to try it out in your school or district. 

### What if I need licenses that only last a semester instead of a full year?
The standard Student License term is for one year, but it can be broken into semesters as needed. Just talk to one of our [School Specialists](mailto:schools@ozaria.com) to discuss your needs.

<!-- ### How do I transfer a license from one student to another?
A Full License can be removed from a student at any time before the license expires, and assigned to another student. To do so, go to that student's class, click the "License Status" tab, and click "Revoke License" from the student you wish to revoke the license from. This student will not be able to play any new levels that require a license (they will still be able to access any levels they've already started). The license will be available to assign to another student (the license expiration date will remain the same) -- see the [Student Licenses](/teachers/licenses) page for all of your available licenses.

### How do I share licenses to other teachers in my organization?
If you have Full Licenses, you can share access to them with other teachers in your organization. Navigate to the [Student Licenses tab](/teachers/licenses), then click the "Share Licenses" link below any group of licenses. This will popup a dialog that allows you to add teachers to the shared licenses.

You can only add teachers in your organization that have already created a Teacher Account ([here's how](/teachers/resources/getting-started)). Once a teacher has been added to a shared license pool, they have the ability to use any of the licenses you've shared.

When a license has been used, it is not available to be used by another teacher until that teacher revokes the license from the student (see [How to Transfer a License](#how-do-i-transfer-a-license-from-one-student-to-another)). -->

### Do we link to Google Classroom?
Yes! Be sure to use the Google Single Sign-On (SSO) Modal to sign up for your teacher account. If you already have an account using your google email, use the Google SSO modal to log in next time. In the Create Class modal, you will see an option to Link Google Classroom. We only support rostering via Google Classroom at this time.

Note: You must use Google SSO to sign up or log-in at least once in order to see the Google Classroom integration option.

### What if a student already has a Ozaria account but they aren't using Google Sign In?
**Student with Ozaria account that they use Google SSO with:**
If they are added to the teacher's google classroom using the same google account, and the teacher has imported the classroom to Ozaria, then the student on Ozaria will automatically have this new classroom added to their account.

**Student with Ozaria account that they don't use Google SSO with:**
If a student already has a Ozaria account and they use their username or email address to sign in (and it's not the same email address as their Google SSO), then they have two options:
1. They can join their teacher's class using the Class Code that the teacher can provide.
2. They can sign in with their Google SSO instead, but they will not have any saved progress from their existing account.

Finally, if their email address that they have on their existing Ozaria account is the same as the email address of their Google SSO account, the student will be added to the classroom automatically.

### What happens if a student is deleted from a Google Classroom-linked Ozaria classroom?
If a student is deleted from the Ozaria classroom, they will not be deleted from the respective Google classroom. If the teacher uses the "Sync Google Classroom" button, the student will be re-added to the Ozaria classroom unless the teacher has also removed that student from the Google Classroom.

Similarly, if a student is removed from the Google Classroom after it has been imported to Ozaria, they will not be removed from the Ozaria class automatically. The teacher will need to remove the student via Ozaria UI.

### Can a teacher view progress in Ozaria via Google Classroom?
We don't currently support Assignments or any Google Classroom Stream functionality (which would allow activity from Ozaria to show up in Google Classroom, or to allow teachers to assign courses directly from Google Classroom).
