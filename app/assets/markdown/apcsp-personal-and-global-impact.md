## What is the Emerging Technology Project?
The emerging technology project is a multi-day project that will allow students to apply what they have learned in Unit 7 through the creation of a computational artifact. Students will research an emerging technology and create some form of computational artifact to show what the technology is, how it works, and its impact on the world.
 
### What you need:
- Links to articles describing emerging technologies. You do not have to provide all articles for the students, but it may be helpful to have a few to help guide them. Look at sites such as Forbes, Wired, and Science Daily
 
Students will begin by reading an article about an emerging computing innovation. They will then further research and analyze the innovation and its impacts on the economy, culture, and society. They must find and properly cite additional sources for their research. The students have to discover what the technology is, how it works, and how it could impact users around the world. In particular, they should focus on both the beneficial and harmful effects of the technology. After about two days of research, the students will create a computational artifact that highlights their findings then present to the rest of the class. LO 1.2.2[P2], LO 1.2.3[P2], LO 7.1.1[P4], LO 7.1.2[P4], LO 7.2.1[P1], LO 7.3.1[P4], LO 7.4.1[P1], LO 7.5.1[P1], LO 7.5.2[P5]
 
### Discussion Questions:
- How did you choose the design of your computational artifact? How does it showcase the technology you researched?
- Describe how others could contribute to the technology you found. How could you help to improve it?
- How will this technology impact other fields?
- What are the benefits of this technology? The potential harms? Does that change when looking at people of different age groups, genders, countries, or economic status?
- What kind of trouble did you have finding appropriate sources?
