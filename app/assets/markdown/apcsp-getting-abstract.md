# Getting Abstract!
 
Learning Objective:
2.2.3 Identify multiple levels of abstractions that are used when writing programs.
 
 
#### Activity #1: Discussion of Layers of Abstraction
 
 
Abstraction is something we use every day in our lives without even thinking about it!
 
Choose a common everyday object to use as the focus of your discussion. For the purpose of illustrating the exercise, we'll use a book as the object. 
 
1. Write the word "book" in the middle of the board and circle it.
2. Ask the students, "Ok, but what makes you think this is a book? What *is* a book?
3. Continue to write the students' answers on the board, surrounding the word "book". 
On the left, write things that describe the physical properties of the book like: "it has pages", "it has a cover", "there are words in it".
On the right, write things that describe the idea or purpose of a book: "it contains facts or ideas", "it tells a story", "it describes characters and events", "it has action and adventure and romance".
4. Depending on the students' answers, steer the discussion until you have filled in details on both sides. For example:
"How do you know *this* is a book? You can't see the writing on the pages from there. You haven't seen the story, or the ideas inside. What about this object makes you think it's a book?"
"These things describe what a book is, physically… but some books aren't made of paper, they're electronic. Are both of those things books? When you write a book report, you don't usually say things like 'It is rectangular, and made of cardboard and paper and ink'. How do you think about a book when writing a report?"
5. Then ask the students to go to an even lower level of abstraction:
> "Ok, so this is a book because it's a sortof flat rectangular object made of paper, with some cardboard on the top and bottom and along one edge. But how do you know it's made of these things? Light is reflecting off the book into your eyes. Your eye turns the light into electrical impulses in your optical nerve, and that leads to chemical reactions in your brain, which access this abstract idea of a "book" in your mind. So is this bunch of paper and cardboard a book, or is the book the idea you use as an abstraction of this whole collection of properties?"
6. "So this book contains knowledge and ideas and stories and emotions. Those things started out as a series of chemical reactions in the authors brain, which they translated into letters and words and sentences, which they translated into ink making shapes on paper, which was sent through time and space to you, where you converted it back into chemicals in your brain that represent - maybe -the same ideas and knowledge and emotions that the author had. This is similar to the way computers work. The computer only knows about 1's and 0's. But through a series of abstractions, it converts these 1's and 0's into electrical impulses in wires, or radio waves for wireless signals… and another computer receives those signals and translates them back into 1's and 0's, and then into letters and words and images."
7. At the end, you should have the word "book" in the middle of the board, circled. Surrounding it are a lot of other things that make up the concept of a book, from chemicals in a brain, to stories of adventure or scientific knowledge.
 
Sum up the discussion by reinforcing - "All of this stuff on the board is what a 'book' is. But, if you had to think about all of these things every time you saw book, we'd all be trapped in thought every time we walked into a  room with a bookshelf! This is why abstractions are useful."
