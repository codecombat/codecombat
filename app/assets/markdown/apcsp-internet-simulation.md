#### Activity
# The Internet - Internet Simulation
 
#### AP Computer Science Principles: Learning Objectives:

[LO 2.3.1] Use models and simulations to represent phenomena. [P3]

[LO 6.1.1] Explain the abstractions in the Internet and how the Internet functions. [P3]

[LO 6.2.1] Explain characteristics of the Internet and the systems built on it. [P5]

[LO 6.2.2] Explain how the characteristics of the Internet influence the systems built on it. [P4]

[LO 6.3.1] Identify existing cybersecurity concerns and potential options to address these issues with the Internet and the systems built on it. [P1]
 
### What is packet transfer?
 
Packet transfer is a way of moving data through the Internet. It involves breaking up the data into smaller pieces, called packets, when sending it over a network.
 
#### What you need:
- A shape made out of Legos, or something else that can be broken into smaller pieces. A piece of paper with a written message or image would also work.
 
Students will participate in a whole-class interactive activity to simulate the secure transfer of data across the internet. Each student will research the role of a different component or device then simulate the part as assigned. The whole class will work together to deliver the teacher-made packet to be delivered and assembled into a message. At the end of the activity, students will write a short summary of the simulation and analyze how well it represented the Internet. `LO 2.3.1[P3], LO 6.1.1[P3], LO 6.2.1[P5], LO 6.2.2[P4], LO 6.3.1[P1]`
 
### Discussion Questions:
- How well did the classâ€™s simulation represent the actual process?
- Explain in your own words how packet processing works.
- Why are packets useful?
- How did the class handle security? What vulnerabilities are there still? How could you address them?
