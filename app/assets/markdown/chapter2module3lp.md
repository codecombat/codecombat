# Chapter 2: Module 3 Lesson Plan

# Overview
Module 3 consists of all the content from **The Moon Dancers** to **Onward to Xing'chen**.

**Learning Objectives**

 - Explain what a variable is and why variables are useful in developing programs.
 - Define and modify variables to help accomplish a goal.

**Standards**

  - CSTA Standards
      - 1B-AP-09: Create programs that use variables to store and modify data.
      - 2-AP-11: Create clearly named variables that represent different data types and perform operations on their values.

# Materials

# Content Background

- Key Terms
    - **Variable**: Used to store information that is needed later in a program
    - **Assignment**: Using the = operator to give a value to a variable
- Explanation of instructional pathway
    - Module 3 comes after students learn about debugging and before students learn about conditionals/branching logic.

# Narrative Background

The hero and Vega have stumbled on a night carnival. Vega takes the opportunity to introduce the hero to a new concept—variables. The hero then meets Capella, who is the leader of the Moon Dancers and an expert in illusion magic. Capella makes a deal with the hero: they can get a ride if the hero helps clean up the carnival. The hero uses variables to help with this, and meets Octans, head of the guards, along the way. The group starts the journey when Vega and the hero are interrupted by Tengshe (Lizard People)! The hero helps defeat the Tengshe, and Capella is convinced to help the hero go to Xing&#39;chen.

# Instructional Tips

**Common Student Misconceptions**

- Students may have trouble understanding why they need to use variables instead of typing in names/values directly. Explain to them that while some of the variables they are using in these levels may not feel like the most useful, down the line when their programs are longer and they need to remember more information, this will be a key skill.
- Students may have trouble understanding the = sign as an assignment operator. Be sure to reinforce this with the examples in Cinematics.

**Differentiation**

- Students who finish early should answer these reflection questions:
    - Did variables make it easier for you to complete these levels? Why or why not?
    - Why is it important to name variables clearly?
    - What was the most challenging level of this module? Why?
    - What was the most fun level of this module? Why?
- Go over the Intro content as a group with students who are having trouble grasping the concept of variables.
