##### Chapter 2: Module 2 Lesson Plan
# Module 2: Debugging

## Overview

Module 2 consists of all the content from **Bugs, Bugs, Bugs** to **A Hero's Work**.

This Lesson Plan will help you to facilitate Module 2 of _Chapter 2: The Moon Dancers_ in your classroom. Students will be introduced to debugging techniques and how to address errors in their code.

Note: Autocomplete for students has been turned off for these levels to facilitate problem-solving related to debugging.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this Ozaria module, students will be able to:

- Define and differentiate between logic errors and syntax errors.
- Explain the importance of debugging and iteration in the programming process.
- Identify and fix syntax and logic errors.

### CSTA Standards

This module was designed to align to the following K-12 CSTA standards:

- 1A-AP-10: Develop programs with sequences or simple loops, to express an idea or address a problem.
- 1A-AP-11: Decompose (break down) the steps needed to solve a problem into a precise sequence of instructions.
- 1A-AP-14: Debug (identify and fix) errors in an algorithm or program that includes sequences and simple loops.
- 1A-AP-15: Using correct terminology, describe steps taken and choices made during the iterative process of program development.

## Recommended Prep

To prepare to support students as they work through Module 2 of _Chapter 2: The Moon Dancers_, it is highly recommended that you:

Work through _Chapter 2: The Moon Dancers_ Module 2 on your own.
- As you’re working through, note down places where you were tripped up or had misunderstandings. These will likely be the same places where students struggle.
- Get familiar with all the systems within the code editor including:

**Goals**
![Goals displayed in Level UI in the top-right corner](/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/chapter1/goals.png)
- Check off automatically as students complete various checkpoints in the levels and projects. 
- Ensure students use these to guide their work on levels and milestones. 

**Code Bank**
![Code Bank displayed on the left-hand side](/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/chapter1/codebank.png)
- A resource for students to see methods and tools they can use in their programs. This will give them descriptions of each method/tool and examples to work from. 
- Ensure students look at these before asking about what step they should take next in problem-solving.

**Error Messages**

- These will pop up automatically when students have errors, either in syntax or logic. 
- Ensure students read these to understand where in their code something has gone wrong.

**Vega Messages**

- Messages that serve as additional hints and support.
- Both include introductory messages and, in some levels, messages triggered by specific interaction.

## In Classroom

### Lesson Facilitation

Once they have started in Module 2, students will be able to move through at their own pace. If you would like to stop students at key checkpoints (refer to the Module 2 Overview as a roadmap) to make sure the class is on the same page, you could do so in the following ways:

- Have students pause once they reach a new Cutscene, and watch Cutscenes together as a class.
    - When to use this method: When you have students who usually work at roughly the same pace and you want students to be approximately at the same place in the narrative to foster a sense of class community.
- Have students pause once they reach Concept Checks.
    - When to use this method: When you want to leverage Concept Checks as formative assessment. You can go over the answer to the Interactive as a whole class so students who are having trouble with the concepts can review before moving on.

### Common Student Misconceptions

- Students, especially those coming from drag-and-drop programming language backgrounds, may struggle with the transition to typed code. If you find that a large number of students are having trouble adjusting to typing in code or understanding the available systems, you can do a demo where you work step-by-step through a level and explain your steps along the way.
- Students may struggle with the transition from Module 1 to Module 2, as the autocomplete feature has been turned off. Guide them to look closely at spelling and syntax, as these will be particularly important for levels and challenges related to identifying and fixing syntax errors.

### Extensions and Differentiation
**Extensions for advanced students**
- Have students reflect on their debugging process by answering the following questions in writing:
    - What questions do you ask yourself when your code doesn&#39;t work the first time you run it?
    - How do you identify where the problem is?
    - How do you test that your code is working?
    - Did you ever get frustrated during this module? When and why?

**Differentiation for students who are struggling**
- Direct students to go back to the map and re-watch the Intro to better retain introduced content.
- Have students write down in English, step by step, what they think the code in the levels they&#39;re struggling with. Then, have them work with a partner to translate these steps into code.
