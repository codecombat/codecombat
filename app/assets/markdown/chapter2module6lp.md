# Instructional Tips

In this Module, students will be creating their own projects that showcase their creativity and the skills that they learned throughout Unit 1.

Ensure that students have access to the Project Rubric so they know what the requirements are and can keep those in mind as they plan and develop their projects.

Students may work at different paces, so encourage those who work faster to go beyond the bare minimum requirements and create something unique and creative.
