Jump to: [Activities](#activities) | [Performance Tasks](#performance-tasks) | [Learning Objectives](#learning-objectives)
## Overview
Students begin the course focusing on Creativity, Programming and Global Impact, setting the tone for CodeCombat’s holistic approach to computer science. They will have hands-on experience with programming right out of the gate with the first programming component, Introduction to Computer Science, which leads them through learning basic coding concepts from sequencing to while loops [5.1, 5.4]. They’ll also work through the Web Development 1 and Game Development 1 levels, which provide two opportunities to create standalone projects that can be shared with their friends and family [1.2, 1.3]. 

Building programming confidence from the very start is a critical component to our curriculum strategy — in recognizing current challenges with student recruitment and retention, we wanted to ensure that we quickly dispel notions that only certain types of students were ‘good at coding’. Through various collaborative and teacher-driven activities [P6], students learn how to work through the engineering cycle [1.1] in a process they can later replicate to solve more complex problems and build more complex artifacts.

Finally, in their Computing Lesson activity, students will find and evaluate research sources for their lesson. Working on these skills at the beginning will be useful throughout the rest of the course as they dig into various topics.
**Enduring Understandings** 
- EU 1.1 Creative development can be an essential process for creating computational artifacts.
- EU 1.2 Computing enables people to use creative development processes to create computational artifacts for creative expression or to solve a problem.
- EU 1.3 Computing can extend traditional forms of human expression and experience.
- EU 5.1 Programs can be developed for creative expression, to satisfy personal curiosity, to create new knowledge, or to solve problems (to help people, organizations, or society).
- EU 5.4 Programs are developed, maintained, and used by people for different purposes.
- EU 7.5 An investigative process is aided by effective organization and selection of resources. Appropriate technologies and tools facilitate the accessing of information and enable the ability to evaluate the credibility of sources.
