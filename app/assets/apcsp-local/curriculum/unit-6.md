# Unit 6: Preparing for the Exam
-------
This is time set aside prior to the exam to give students an opportunity to review their materials and understand the way the test will be administered.

#### **Question Format**
Review with students the format of the questions, as described in the [AP CS Principles Course Description](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf), p 84.

#### **Program Format**
The exam includes questions which test programming skill while being language-agnostic. Have students review the format of the logic that will be included in the exam. This is described in the [AP Computer Science Principles Exam Reference Sheet](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf) (page 14).

#### **Question Practice**
The [AP CS Principles Course Description](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf) provides sample questions on pages 86-102. Have students practice this exam. This will give them an understanding of the sorts of questions they will be asked and how various topics will be addressed.

#### **Review**
Have students review their materials, including notes and submitted written work. Encourage students to take the discussion questions and assessment questions and practice answering those questions with each other. Assist students in understanding topics they continue to struggle with, and encourage them to do independent research on those topics as needed.
