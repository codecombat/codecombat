# Unit 3: Designing Arcade Games
-------
Jump to: [Activities](#activities) | [Performance Tasks](#performance-tasks) | [Learning Objectives](#learning-objectives)

## Overview
The keystone project of Unit 3 lies at the end of the Game Development 2 levels, where students will have a chance to design and implement a complex, Pac-Man style arcade game [1.2], incorporating skills to construct algorithms from the previous unit into a game development environment. In contrast to Unit 1’s Game Development levels, which focused on declarative syntax that enabled students to define in-game properties and spawn objects, this unit’s levels challenge students to think more broadly about game mechanics — questioning and dissecting what makes a game engaging, how games can be tuned to easier or harder difficulty. As another practice opportunity for the final Create task, it also encourages students to improve their communication and collaboration skills around program design and intentionality, both as a game designer and as a game player. 

This unit also picks up where the previous left off in terms of understanding abstraction. Where in Unit 2, students learned about the specific abstractions that drive the Internet, they are now ready to approach abstractions as a concept more broadly, to start seeing how abstractions can be powerful frameworks to enable complex systems design [2.2, 5.3].  

In keeping with our mission to prepare students for the job market, and being cognizant of the ways in which engineering skills combined with humanities and civics is the way of the future, this unit also introduces students to crowdsourcing, a method by which many real-world engineers and computer scientists collaborate to solve large-scale problems [7.1]. They will also have an opportunity to connect last unit’s exploration of the Internet with an abstraction that allows them to engage with modelling and simulation [6.2]
