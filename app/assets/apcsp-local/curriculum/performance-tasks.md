# Performance Task Overview

-----
Jump to: [Performance Task: Create](#performance-task-create) | [Performance Task: Explore](#performance-task-explore) 

Students are assessed at the end of their AP Computer Science Principles course via both through-course and end-of-course assessments. This overview provides details on how teachers should use CodeCombat to prepare for the two through-course Performance tasks: Create and Explore. 

Additional detail about these tasks can be found in the [AP CS Principles Course Description](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf) starting from page 71. Teachers should distribute the [Student Performance Task Directions Handout](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf) [PDF] to their class as it contains information specific to the student experience. 

Teachers are required to set aside 8 hours of in-class time for the Explore task, and 12 hours for the Create task. We recommend that the Explore task be done in conjunction with Unit 3, and the Create task be done in conjunction with Unit 5. Below, we outline ways for students to practice and understand the rubrics for these tasks well in advance of the final projects.

## Performance Task: Create
Programming is a creative process that brings ideas to life. Programs can help solve problems, enable innovations, or express personal interests. For the Create Performance Task, students will develop a program of their choice, in a programming language of their choice.

CodeCombat's Computer Science (CS) courses teach programming through a series of puzzles (levels) the students solve with code. Designing and implementing an original creative program requires a different approach than solving a specific, given problem - and that's where CodeCombat's Game Development (GD) and Web Development (WD) courses shine: each course leads up to a final project, where the student creates her own original work. These projects serve as a great opportunity to practice for the AP CSP Create Task, which requires the student to submit a program of their own creation, either to solve a problem they're interested in, or as a creative expression. (Learning Objectives 5.1.1 and 5.1.2)

By playing CodeCombat's Game and Web Development courses, students will gain valuable practice in applying the iterative "design - implement - test" process, creating their own abstractions and algorithms, and collaborating with peers as co-creators and play testers. Multiple practice opportunities throughout CodeCombat’s AP CS Principles syllabus will allow students to focus on various components of the Create task. This guide focuses on the first of those practice opportunities in Game Development 1.

Side note: Students may choose to develop their final project within CodeCombat, or they may use another programming environment that they're familiar with.

#### **AP CS Principles Create Task Requirements**

    - Algorithm
    - Abstraction
- Create a video that displays the running of their program and demonstrates its functionality.
- Write responses to questions about their program.
- Submit their entire program code to the AP Digital Portfolio.

More detail on each scoring component can be found in the [AP CS Principles Course Description](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf). Students can also refer directly to the [Student Performance Task Directions Handout](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf) [PDF].  


#### **Practicing for Create**

In the chart below, we highlight the portions of the final Create project that students will be able to practice in each of the Game Development units.  

**CodeCombat Create Practice Opportunities**

|                       | Game Dev 1 | Game Dev 2 | Game Dev 3 |
|-----------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Iterative Process** |            |            |            |

Refer to the three Create Task Practice guides as students reach the final project for each Game Development course so that they can be used as practice opportunities.

- [Performance Task: Create Practice 2](/apcsp/markdown/create-task-practice-2)
- [Performance Task: Create Practice 3](/apcsp/markdown/create-task-practice-3)


#### **Creating & Submitting Final Create Task**
Students will need to submit a project to the AP Digital Portfolio that includes a new application that they’ve written from scratch. They are allowed to collaborate with another student on the creation of the program code, but must submit their own video and written responses. 

Teachers should refer to page 79 in the [AP CS Principles Course Description](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf) for specific instructions. Students should also be provided with the [Performance Task Directions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf) [PDF], as it contains critical information on how they should prepare to submit this project.  

We recommend that students aim to submit their entire project by early March so that they’ll have ample time to correct any issues, and prepare for the final AP exam.

## Performance Task: Explore 

The Explore task provides students with an opportunity to research computing innovations and understand how they impact the world around us. Similar to the Create task, students will need to follow specific instructions to create a computational artifact, record a video demonstration and provide written responses for their final submission to the AP Digital Portfolio. 

Refer to the [Explore Task Practice Guide](/apcsp/curriculum/explore) for opportunities to use in-unit activities to practice for the Explore task. 

#### **Impact of Computing Innovations**

In this task, students select and investigate a computing innovation that has had or has impacts on society, economy, or culture, and consumes, produces, and/or transforms data. A computing innovation is an innovation that includes a computer or program code as an integral part of its function.

These innovations include physical innovations such as self-driving cars, or non-physical computing software, such as smartphone apps, or computing concepts, such as cryptocurrency.

Students should explain the innovation's intended purpose or function, it's harmful and beneficial effects, and produce a computational artifact that illustrates, represents, or explains the computing innovation's intended purpose, its function, or its effect.

Students will also provide written responses to a series of prompts.

#### **AP CS Principles Explore Task Requirements**

Summary of the "Explore" Performance Task for AP CS Principles (See Page 73 of the [AP CS Principles Course Description](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf)):
- 16% of the final score.
- Minimum of 8 class hours.
- Submission Deadline: April 30

#### **Creating & Submitting Final Explore Task**
Students will need to submit their Explore task to the AP Digital Portfolio that includes a new application that they’ve written from scratch. They are not allowed to collaborate with another student on this task, unlike with the Create task. 

Refer to page 73 in the [AP CS Principles Course Description](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf) for specific instructions. Students should also be provided with the [Performance Task Directions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf) [PDF], as it contains critical information on how they should prepare to submit this project.    

We recommend that students practice as well as submit their final Explore task before the end of the first semester, since the Explore task does not depending on more advanced algorithmic or programming concepts like the Create task does.
