# Unit 4: Abstractions Are Magic
-------
Jump to: [Activities](#activities) | [Performance Tasks](#performance-tasks) | [Learning Objectives](#learning-objectives)

## Overview
In previous units, students were exposed to the concepts of abstraction by way of thinking about how the internet works, and by developing their own abstractions inside program code. In Unit 4, the goal is to demonstrate the power and magic of abstractions by exploring how they are used in other areas of computing — from how abstractions are fundamental to how computer hardware works to translate human-readable code into forms that a machine can interpret [2.1], to higher levels of abstraction that allow programs to interact with each other, providing inputs and outputs without necessitating that each program knows the entirety of the code [2.3]. 

In parallel, students will be completing levels in Computer Science 3 — which covers more advanced programming concepts like functions with returns, booleans, and arithmetic [5.5] — as well as beginning the Game Development 3 levels, which begins to scaffold how students will build their own abstractions, enabling ever-more complex computational artifacts culminating in the final game development level in the next unit and the Create task. 

Having this foundational knowledge enables students to confidently approach one of the more challenging projects in this curriculum — the Simulation activity, which provides students with a complex model of prey-predator behavior and gives them the levers to adjust and change the outcomes [2.3].

## Performance Tasks
There are no formal opportunities for students to practice for the Create task in this unit since the levels in Game Development 3 span both this unit and the following one. However, we recommend that students and teachers familiarize themselves with the requirements of the Create task during this time. In Unit 5, there will be one last practice opportunity at the end of Game Development 3. Refer to the [Performance Task Overview](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/curriculum/performance-tasks) guide for more details.
