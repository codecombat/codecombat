# Overview of Explore Task
------ 
## Impact of Computing Innovations

In this task, students select and investigate a computing innovation that has had or has impacts on society, economy, or culture, and consumes, produces, and/or transforms data. A computing innovation is an innovation that includes a computer or program code as an integral part of its function.

These innovations include physical innovations such as self-driving cars, or non-physical computing software, such as smartphone apps, or computing concepts, such as cryptocurrency.

Students should explain the innovation's intended purpose or function, it's harmful and beneficial effects, and produce a computational artifact that illustrates, represents, or explains the computing innovation's intended purpose, its function, or its effect.

Students will also provide written responses to a series of prompts.
## AP CS Principles Explore Task Requirements

Summary of the "Explore" Performance Task for AP CS Principles (See Page 73 of the Course and Exam Description):

- 16% of the final score.
- Minimum of 8 class hours.
- Submission Deadline: April 30

Teachers should distribute the [Student Performance Task Directions Handout](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf) [PDF] to their class as it contains information specific to the student experience. 

## Practice Opportunities
Throughout the curriculum, we provide two activities that serve as opportunities for students to practice the Explore task. During the final task, students are not allowed to collaborate with each other, or ask for corrections from the teacher; so these practice activities are important opportunities to assist the students with the skills and knowledge they'll need to succeed at the Explore Task.

The primary skills required to complete the Explore task are (as described on pg 73-76 of the [AP Computer Science Principles Course Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf)):

- Research
- Creation of a Computational Artifact
- Writing Responses to Prompts

These skills are practiced in the following activities:

#### **Create a Computing Lesson**

The Unit 1: Create a Computing Lesson provides practice at creating a Computational Artifact, and some of the Written Prompts which are listed below.

In this lesson, the students will create a Computational Artifact about a computing concept they learned about in Unit 1. You should go over with the students all the requirements and restrictions that make up an effective Computational Artifact, as laid out in the Explore Task Requirements on page 72 and 74-76 of the AP CSP Course and Exam Description, for example: 
Discuss the computational tools that can be used to create effective computational artifacts.
Discuss computational artifacts that are effective and ineffective.

*NOTE:* For a complete list of Explore Task preparation requirements, please see the [AP Computer Science Principles Course Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf)!

You should also point out that, while the students are able to collaborate when creating the Computational Artifact for this practice project - they will not be able to collaborate on the final Explore Task Project. This and other restrictions for the Explore task should be explained to students. See Administering the Task: Role of the Teacher on p76.

Have the students write responses to the following Written Prompts:

- Provide information on your computing topic and computational artifact:
- Name the computing topic that is represented by your computational artifact.
- Describe the computing topic's intended purpose and function.
- Describe how your computational artifact illustrates, represents, or explains the computing topic's intended purpose, its function, or its effect. (Must not exceed 100 words)
- Describe your development process, explicitly identifying the computing tools and techniques you used to create your artifact. Your description must be detailed enough so that a person unfamiliar with those tools and techniques will understand your process. (Must not exceed 100 words)


#### **Emerging Technology**

The Emerging Technology Project is the second practice opportunity for the Explore Task, and should cover all aspects required for the final Project, including Research, Computational Artifacts, and Written Responses.

Be sure that students are familiar with all requirements and restrictions listed on pages 74-76, and provide written answers to all the Writing Prompts on page 110 of the [AP Computer Science Principles Course Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf).
