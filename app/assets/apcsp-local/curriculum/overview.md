##### Program Goals
## Evolving computer science education through game-based learning

#### **Foundation from real typed code**
CodeCombat’s core mission is to change the way that computer science is taught. When we started CodeCombat, we knew that everything out there for learning to code was failing to serve most people, and we knew we could make it better – we could make the solution we’d wished we’d had when we were kids. 

Programming is magic, and we wanted to give all learners the feeling of wizardly power at their fingertips by using real typed code on our platform. As it turns out, that was the key to get students to learn much faster as well; by not relying on training wheels like block-based code (which are especially underwhelming for students older than elementary school age), we empowered our students to learn programming syntax and code structure and got them to realize their creative potential much sooner. 

#### **Computer science for everyone**
It just so happened that as CodeCombat’s product matured, computer science turned out to be the number one job skill, so we expanded the scope of our vision to include not only programming skills, but also the broader aspects of computer science that we knew would set our students up for long-term success in the job market. 

Making computer science accessible to every student on Earth isn’t just about giving them programming tools -- it’s also about helping students and teachers understand what computer science is, and  who computer scientists are. It’s about shattering common stereotypes by creating curriculum that is friendly to beginner students AND beginner teachers, focuses on the amazing applications of computing and not just the technical jargon, and provides integrated, actionable feedback so that learners can quickly grasp new concepts within the context in which they’re first learned. We’ve made sure that in-game, students can choose characters that can reflect their gender and race identities, knowing the importance of representation and its effect on students’ perceptions. 

The AP Computer Science Principles course is CodeCombat’s natural accomplice in achieving the goals of reaching every potential computer science learner. The course’s focus on driving diversity, increasing access and preparing students for the job markets of today and tomorrow aligns closely with our platform’s core mission. We believe that our approach to the well-defined standards set out in the course description can inspire a brand new generation of students to see themselves as “computer science people”, continue onto Computer Science and adjacent majors, and bring a fresh perspective to technology industries and beyond.

##### Curriculum Summary
## Our approach to AP Computer Science Principles

#### **Big Ideas & Computational Thinking Practices**
Central to our approach are two main values: 1) that programming confidence should be built up over time such that when students tackle the final Performance Task for Create, they are more than prepared to write program code from scratch that exceeds the rubric’s requirements, and 2) that the students are provided ample opportunities to connect the technology with its effects, so as to become thoughtful creators and critics of technology as they enter the real world. Activities and discussions that touch both Big Idea 5 (Programming) and Big Idea 7 (Global Impact) are tackled in every unit of the curriculum from start to finish to reinforce those priorities throughout the school year. It means that throughout the course, students are provided with opportunities to understand for themselves what the high-level impact of programming can be, even from the initial pieces of code that they type.

Pairing Programming with Impact in every unit means that other Big Ideas are also interrogated through this same lens -- students will learn about important topics like data, security and the Internet; model simulations and create computational artifacts, all while connecting what they’re doing to the larger technology industry and its impact on society. There are also ample opportunities for students to express creativity throughout all of the units, via programming projects that result in digital artifacts as well as in-class activities that help them to see that computer science is not just a field for people who like engineering. They’ll be encouraged to imagine the best ways to construct algorithms in order to complete puzzles, then consider the best ways to make their algorithms efficient by using abstractions.

In addition, we’ve approached the Computational Thinking Practices with an eye towards preparing students for real-life working scenarios where they will be tasked not only with writing literal code, but thoughtfully considering the best solutions to a problem, and practicing necessary interpersonal skills in order to contribute on a team. To that end, we’ve strongly encouraged teachers to allow students to pair program with each other as they communicate ideas through code, as well as approach discussions and projects with a collaborative lens. 

Students will have ample opportunity to create computational artifacts of their own through programming projects, and both the practice and final Performance Tasks. In presenting those artifacts, they will also be expected to provide explanations and clear communication about the purpose of their work as it relates to the world and context around them. These also serve as several of many milestones where they can analyze computational artifacts - project guidelines will outline ways for students to evaluate their classmates’ projects from a critical and solution-oriented lens, as well as offer feedback and guidance for others’ projects while practicing critical thinking and analysis. 

Students will also come to understand the power and magic behind abstractions -- how they are used for everything from making program code more efficient to allowing the internet to become a democratic environment due to the abstraction of protocols and communication standards. Additional opportunities to practice communication are offered in activities such as data analysis projects and in-class discussions about the structures of the internet, designed to make sure students engage with the materials and are able to communicate important aspects of it back to their classmates. 

#### **Performance Tasks**
Along with covering the material as outlined in each unit, we also wanted to make sure students would be set up for success in both of the required AP Computer Science Principles performance tasks, Create and Explore. 

Our approach towards Explore is to allow students to practice addressing and discussing computing innovations in tandem with topics like Computing and Personal & Global Impact; we allot time in our syllabus towards the beginning of the school year for the final Explore task to encourage students to discover the range of innovations and applications early on in the course. 

Our approach towards Create is to usher students towards writing creative program code as quickly as possible to reduce anxiety and imposter syndrome around the final project. We’ve also integrated the Create practice opportunities into the most compelling programming units involving Game Development, and provide ample teacher guidance to use those opportunities to build student confidence for the Create task they’ll submit. 

#### **Assessment Values**
We approached assessment opportunities for students throughout the course with a few focal points: we want them to reflect our values as a platform, and we want to make sure that both teachers and students feel confident going into the final AP exam. 

Two major components of the assessments provided as part of our curriculum are that they are 1) scaleable, and 2) integrated. Scalability reduces the time spent on assessments by the teachers. The less they have to evaluate and handle logistics for assessments, the more students they can handle and the better they can help students. It also makes our product more accessible to more people, especially people without a school program for CS, including those who are underrepresented. This also supports our ability to prepare teachers. And, by integrating assessments with learning, creating, and active playing, assessments are more efficient and more accurate, since students are evaluated in a more “real life” context. In a job, employees are not handed tests. They are evaluated by how they learn new things, what they create and how they execute soft skills. By incorporating assessments into other pieces, students are also more engaged. This also emphasizes active learning over passive learning.

## Program requirements

#### **Programming Languages**
CodeCombat’s AP Computer Science Principles course can be used to learn programming in either JavaScript or Python, which teachers will choose upon creation of their classroom inside the CodeCombat platform.

#### **Teacher Verification**
Teachers who apply for and are approved through CodeCombat’s verification process will be given access to our full AP Computer Science Principles curriculum, including all professional development and assessment materials. The verification process does not cost teachers anything, but is designed to maximize our professional development efforts and reduce exposure of materials such as answer keys to students. 

#### **Minimum Hardware/Software Specifications**
CodeCombat runs best on computers with at least 4GB of RAM, on a modern browser such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge. Chromebooks with 2GB of RAM may have minor graphics issues in courses beyond Computer Science 3, though there should be minimal issues with the recommended content for AP Computer Science Principles as outlined. A minimum of 200 Kbps bandwidth per student is required, although 1+ Mbps is recommended.

#### **Professional Development**
Our professional development materials are made available to all verified teachers at no cost. Professional development is self-directed and self-paced, taking place online and in collaborative forums where teachers can ask questions and participate in discussions with other verified teachers and CodeCombat content experts. We encourage all teachers to go through professional development before using CodeCombat as their AP Computer Science Principles curriculum, and we provide support throughout the year as their classes progress through the curriculum.

#### **Student Licenses**
In order for teachers to be able to assign the required CodeCombat courses to students in their class, each student will need a License. Information on license pricing and structure can be obtained by speaking to CodeCombat’s school specialists (email schools@codecombat.com). We recommend that licenses are obtained by early August of the coming school year so students can begin as early as the first day of the fall semester.
