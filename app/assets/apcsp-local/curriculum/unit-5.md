# Unit 5: Connecting Computing

-------
Jump to: [Activities](#activities) | [Performance Tasks](#performance-tasks) | [Learning Objectives](#learning-objectives)
## Overview
The final instructive unit of our curriculum connects each of the important concepts that students have been exploring throughout the year to a larger understanding — that computing is powerful and that students themselves can effect change in the world via computing [3.1]. As students look at real-world applications of the concepts they’ve been building up to, through investigations into datasets [3.2, 3.3], understanding how the complexities of information is transmitted across the internet [6.3], our approach allows them to see how they can become active participants and creators of the technology around them. As reflected in our core values, this completes the student’s journey from a passive consumer of computing to “a computer scientist” in their own right  [7.4]. 

This unit allows students to finish the Game Development 3 levels they began in the previous unit, culminating in the final practice opportunity for the Create task — students build an infinite-runner type game that challenges them to use the abstraction and algorithmic skills they’ve learned to craft a finely tuned game. This, coupled with reflection and iteration opportunities built into the curriculum, sets students up for success as they approach their final Create task.

**Enduring Understandings**  
- EU 3.1 People use computer programs to process information to gain insight and knowledge.  
- EU 3.2 Computing facilitates exploration and the discovery of connections in information.  
- EU 3.3 There are trade-offs when representing information as digital data.  
- EU 6.3 Cybersecurity is an important concern for the Internet and the systems built on it.  
- EU 7.4 Computing innovations influence and are influenced by the economic, social, and cultural contexts in which they are designed and used.

#### **Innovations and Society**
*[Activity Link](/apcsp/markdown/apcsp-innovations-and-society)*

Students will learn how computing affects societies with different socioeconomic or geographic groups.  They will be required to participate in class discussions on these affects, collaborate on a research project analyzing the effect of computing on a group different from themselves, and present their findings to the class.

They will cover these LOs while working through the material for this activity:  
- LO 7.4.1 Explain the connections between computing and real-world contexts, including economic, social, and cultural contexts. [P1]

## Performance Tasks
Students will have opportunities to practice for the Performance Tasks via the following activities: 
– Game Development 3: Final Project (Create Practice)

This will be the third and final practice opportunity for the Create task. Teachers should set aside the required hours for completing the Create task during this unit. Students should also aim to submit their final Create task to the AP Digital Portfolio during this unit. 

Refer to the [Performance Task Overview](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/curriculum/performance-tasks) guide for more details on each opportunity.
