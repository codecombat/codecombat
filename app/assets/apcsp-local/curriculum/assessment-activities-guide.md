## Assessment Guide

Listed below are various types of assessment students will encounter in the curriculum, along with recommendations for how teachers can best utilize them.

Jump to: [Challenge Levels](#challenge-levels) | [Pair Programming](#pair-programming)

#### **Challenge Levels**
Some of the levels students can play are assessments, or challenge, levels. These are designed to see if students have learned the concepts that they have been exploring in previously levels. They are different than teaching levels in the following ways:

**Non-blocking**: a student can continue to play other levels without passed assessment levels.
**Minimal guidance**: while levels which introduce concepts provide code and line-by-line guidance, assessments will have little provided code and will not proscribe solutions. Students must take directions and turn them into coding solutions.

The results of students playing these levels can be found in the classroom page, and can be used to determine if they understand EKs related to logical concepts.

#### **Pair Programming**
Projects, Challenge Levels and Activities with coding provide opportunities for students to collaborate on solutions. Use the Pair Programming guide with these opportunities to practice and assess collaboration.

##### Assessment Questions
- What was different about programming with a partner as opposed to programming alone? [LO 5.1.3]
- How did pairing affect difficulty in coding? [EK 5.1.3A]

## Activity Guide

This guide explains the activities provided in the CodeCombat AP CS Principles curriculum. These are general guidelines for how the activities are run and how they provide learning and assessment opportunities.

Jump to: [Computational Artifact Activity](#computational-artifact-activity) | [Inquiry Activity](#inquiry-activity) | [Project Activity](#project-activity) | [Research Activity](#research-activity) 

#### **Computational Artifact Activity**
Students are tasked with creating a computational artifact, as described on p43 of the AP CS Principles course description. These projects provide students with the opportunity to apply the skills gained in this course to create something their own for a purpose. You can pair this activity with another activity, having the students create artifacts in lieu of a fully written report (though students should still submit something in writing which explains the artifact). This contextualizes the topic and enables creative expression, and is practice for the Explore Task.

##### Teaching
Before tasking students with creating an artifact, discuss with them what an artifact is, examples of artifacts, and some tools you have for generating artifacts. The computer accessories (VR headsets, 3D printers, cameras) and software (image editors, graphing programs) available to you will inform what sorts of artifacts your students can generate. Provide guidance on how to use these systems, before and during the activity. Have students share their creations with the class and ask **discussion questions**.

##### Assessing
Assess students based on classroom participation during discussion and have them answer **assessment questions** after the activity. Have students answer Explore Task Computational Artifact questions (2a, 2b) as listed in the AP CS Principles student handout p6. Finally, assess elements of Big Idea 1: Creativity with these questions:
- Describe one part of the artifact that you iterated on [EK 1.1.1B]
- How was the computer involved in creating your artifact? [EK 1.2.1B]
-  If you didnâ€™t have a computer, how could you have made the artifact? Would that have been more difficult? [EK 1.2.2A]
-- Did your artifact make use of any existing computational artifacts? [EK 1.2.3A]
- When making the artifact, what is something you and your partner(s) disagreed about? How did you resolve your disagreement? [EK 1.2.4C]
- What is a way in which your artifact could be improved to suit its purpose? [EK 1.2.5B]


#### **Inquiry Activity**
In this activity, students construct knowledge rather than acquiring it. Often this is done in the form of a classroom discussion, where the teacher guides discussion and encourages students to articulate and derive conclusions from their own experiences, both in and outside of the classroom. This not only teaches the knowledge, but also provides student to practice critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and puts the knowledge in context with their lives, making it less abstract and more memorable.

The [AP CS Principles Course Description](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf) also discusses Inquiry based organization activities on page 40.

##### Teaching
Inquiry activities set the stage with a topic **prompt**. They can be provided directly, or lead to by starting with a discussion of experiences. Ask **discussion questions**. Help answer student questions with **key knowledge** provided in the activity, until all of the questions have been answered.

##### Assessing
Assess students based on classroom participation during discussion and have them answer **assessment questions** after the activity.

#### **Project Activity**
Project activities involve creating a game or website through the CodeCombat site. Students take the skills they have been honing through the game in order to build something their own that they can share with friends and family. This provides strong context for the students, where they can see how the tools they learn help them to build programs and websites that they have experienced themselves.

##### Teaching
Projects are open-ended, so help students come up with ideas for what to build. Encourage them to think creatively, consider all the tools they have and pick one or two that they particularly like and see what they can do. Encourage experimentation and collaboration, and walk them through the Design, Implement, Test loop.

##### Assessing
All project activities should include a written response, including as many answers to Create Task prompts as possible. Have students communicate what the purpose of their creation is, and explain parts of their code and how they work in the context of their program.

#### **Research Activity**
Students are given a **prompt** to research. Direct students to find their own answers through research. Students should evaluate their sources for credibility and relevance and properly cite them, see p.41-43 of the AP CS Principles course description. These activities provide an opportunity to learn about key topics through exploration, as well as key skills for finding and evaluating information, all of which will be necessary for the Explore Task.

##### Teaching
Research activities include one or several topics or prompts for students to research. Provide materials and guidance on how to find, assess and properly cite sources in the result. The results are shared with the class, at which point ask **discussion questions**.

##### Assessing
Have students based on classroom participation during discussion and have them answer **assessment questions** after the activity. Also assess the result of the research, which should include a written portion explaining their artifact, similar to the Explore Task. The written portion should be assessed on:
- **Research**. Are there cited sources? Are they appropriate? Are they trustworthy? These should include online or print sources, but may include interviews.
- **Content**. Is the prompt answered? Does it reflect the knowledge which is the target of the activity?
