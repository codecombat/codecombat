# Unit 2: Thinking in Algorithms
-------
Jump to: [Activities](#activities) | [Performance Tasks](#performance-tasks) | [Learning Objectives](#learning-objectives)
## Overview
In this unit, students will focus the bulk of their efforts towards understanding algorithms, the building blocks of program code. Our approach highlights the power of different algorithm structures and how they can be combined and modified to solve ever-more complex problems with ease and efficiency [4.1, 4.2].This continues to build on the confidence that we’re establishing with students in Programming and Algorithms — after spending time in the first unit learning the basics of syntax in either JavaScript or Python, the challenges in Computer Science 2 [5.2] allow them to explore writing basic algorithms. Understanding algorithms will help students as their code complexity increases, and will specifically allow them to tackle the Create task’s algorithmic requirements with ease further in the course. 

While the bulk of unit 2 focuses on what algorithms are, how they are used and provides opportunities for students to practice writing them, a portion of the unit is also dedicated to introducing abstractions, which will be covered in more depth in subsequent units. Via the lens of the internet — a utility that students comprehend and use on a daily basis — we demonstrate how abstractions make a system extensible, flexible and adaptable [6.1]. In addition to learning about the various components of how the internet works, students will be expected to demonstrate understanding of what the internet both enables and is capable of [7.3]
