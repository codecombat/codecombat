# What is AP Computer Science Principles?
-----

AP Computer Science Principles is a brand new AP course launched in the 2016-17 school year. Through CodeCombat’s AP Computer Science Principles Hub, teachers can learn to teach AP Computer Science Principles with a robust curriculum and Professional Development course. No programming experience is required. Teachers will gain the skills, knowledge, resources, and confidence to lead a great AP Computer Science Principles classroom.

CodeCombat is recognized by the College Board as an endorsed provider of curriculum and professional development for AP® Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). This endorsement affirms that all components of CodeCombat’s offerings are aligned to the AP Curriculum Framework standards and the AP CSP assessment. Using an endorsed provider affords schools access to resources including an AP CSP syllabus pre-approved by the College Board’s AP Course Audit, and officially recognized professional development that prepares teachers to teach AP CSP. For more on the overall curriculum framework, we encourage all teachers to [watch the framework presentation](https://cb.collegeboard.org/ap-overview-modules/ap-csp-curriculum-framework/story_html5.html) on the [College Board Overview Modules](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course/course-overview-modules-teachers?course=ap-computer-science-principles). 

Our professional development is not a College Board sponsored AP workshop. Rather, it is developed solely by CodeCombat, an endorsed College Board provider of curriculum and professional development. College Board does offer their own Summer Institutes and Workshops that can be [explored here](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/professional-development/workshops/about-workshops-summer-institutes).

## Step 1: Review Course Overview 

Before beginning this professional development program, every AP CS Principles teacher is required to go through the [College Board Course Overview Modules](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course/course-overview-modules-teachers?course=ap-computer-science-principles). These short tutorials will give you a baseline understanding of the AP CS Principles Curricular Framework, Assessment, Instructional Approaches, and other resources.

Throughout CodeCombat’s professional development, we’ll be referencing the [AP Computer Science Principles Course and Exam description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf), so now is a good time to download the PDF or open it in a new window. 

At this time, please also review and be aware of the [Curricular and Resources Requirements](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/professional-development/curricular-resource-requirements) which outline responsibilities that your educational institute should adhere to in order to provide an appropriate and adequate learning environment for students taking AP CS Principles.

The rest of the professional development will focus on taking these principles and applying them within the CodeCombat environment.

## Step 2: Course Audit
In order to teach an AP sanctioned course, all AP CS Principles teachers must authorize their course through College Board. The AP Course Audit requires the online submission of two documents: the AP Course Audit form and the teacher's syllabus. The AP teacher and the school principal or designated administrator should submit the AP Course Audit form, acknowledging the curricular and resource requirements. The syllabus, detailing how the AP course requirements will be met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.

The [AP CS Principles Course Audit site](https://cb.collegeboard.org/ap-course-audit/courses/ap_computer_science_principles.html)  provides teachers with the tools to create and submit their syllabus for authorization, including curricular requirements, a syllabus development guide, and four annotated sample syllabi. Teachers can choose to create their own syllabus, adopt and submit a sample syllabus, or work with an [endorsed provider](https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles/curricula-pedagogical-support) like CodeCombat and obtain a syllabus ID number to receive course authorization.

As a teacher, you have a two step process for approval:
1. Submit an electronic copy of your syllabus outlining the course. You can use the [CodeCombat syllabus found here](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/curriculum/syllabus) (you can click the "Print this guide" button then use Save as PDF settings in your browser to save the syllabus as a PDF). Our syllabus ID is [awaiting approved ID].
2. Submit an AP Course Audit form. This is an electronic form that you can access using your course audit login [on the Course Audit homepage](http://cb.collegeboard.org/ap-course-audit/teacher.html), that must be approved by a school administrator.

## Computational Thinking Practices

The course is structured around the following six Computer Science Principles Computational Thinking Practices (CTPs). These CTPs enable students to engage with the course content by developing computational artifacts and analyzing data, information, or knowledge for computational use. Additionally the CTPs encourage collaboration and communication amongst students. Each learning objective (LO) is aligned to one of these following computational thinking practices: 

#### **P1: Connecting Computing**: Students study effects of, and draw connections between different computing concepts.
- Identify impacts of computing
- Describe connections between people and computing
- Explain connections between computing concepts 

#### **P2: Creating Computational Artifacts** : Students engage in the creative aspects of computing by designing and developing interesting computational artifacts and apply techniques to problem solve.
- Create a computational artifact with a practical, personal, or societal intent
- Select appropriate techniques to develop a computational artifact
- Use appropriate algorithmic and information management principles

#### **P3: Abstracting**: Students use abstractions to develop models and simulations, use them to make predictions, and analyze efficacy.
- Explain how data, information, or knowledge is represented for computational use
- Explain how abstractions are used in computation or modeling
- Identify abstractions
- Describe modeling in a computational context

#### **P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts**: Students design and produce solutions, models, and artifacts, and then analyze their own computational work as well as work of others.
- Evaluate a proposed solution to a problem
- Locate and correct errors
- Explain how an artifact functions
- Justify appropriateness and correctness of a solution, model, or artifact

#### **P5: Communicating**: Students describe computations and impact of technology, explain and justify designs, and analyze computational artifacts’ results and behaviors.
- Explain the meaning of a result in context
- Describe computation with accurate and precise language, notations, or visualizations
- Summarize the purpose of a computational artifact

#### **P6: Collaborating**: Students collaborate on number of activities, investigations of data sets and production of computational artifacts.
- Collaborate with another student in solving a computational problem
- Collaborate with another student in producing an artifact
- Share the workload by providing individual contributions to an overall collaborative effort
- Foster a constructive, collaborative climate by resolving conflicts and facilitating the contributions of a partner or team member
- Exchange knowledge and feedback with a partner or team member
- Review and revise their work as needed to create a high-quality artifact

Let’s work through an example of how Computational Thinking Practices are woven through an activity. In Unit 3, you’ll find an activity called “[Technology Usability](https://codecombat.com/teachers/resources/apcsp-tech-usability)”, which asks students to examine a website or app that they use from the lens of interaction design best practices. In addition to covering both Learning Objective 1.2.5 and 7.1.1, it also addresses CTP 4. Analyzing Problems and Artifacts (which is the CTP that is associated with both of those Learning Objectives).

Do this activity now (don’t worry, it doesn’t require any programming yet!), following the instructions in the activity and reflecting on the discussion questions. Come back here when you’re done. 

Finished? Congratulations, you’ve just seen your first CTP in action! During this activity, you looked at a computational artifact (the website or app that you chose) and explained how it functions, analyzed it using a heuristics-driven framework in order to justify its appropriateness given the context in which the website or app is being used, and gained knowledge about how artifacts are designed with purpose, all of which lead to a better understanding of the principles behind CTP 4. Analyzing Problems and Artifacts. Each activity in the curriculum has Learning Objectives and Computational Thinking Practices associated with it -- as you continue through the professional development content and come across additional activities, reflect on how that activity addresses the CTPs listed for it.

Read more about each specific CTP in the [course overview, starting on page nine](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf). 

Once you have reviewed each computational thinking practice and finished the above activity, visit CodeCombat’s [APCSP teacher discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp), specifically the “[Computational Thinking Practices Discussion Questions](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/apcsp/4jOXUSlPG4Q)” thread to engage in questions that will help guide activities and ideas to use in your classroom. As part of CodeCombat’s professional development, discuss your answers to two of the questions posed in the thread.
