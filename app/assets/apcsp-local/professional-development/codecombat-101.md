# What is CodeCombat?
-----

CodeCombat is a tool for students in grades 4-12 to learn to write real code, like Python or JavaScript, by playing through a game. It is fun, challenging, and allows students to be creative by creating games, web pages, and quizzes through our project-based courses. It is self-paced, providing hints and practice along the way to those who need. We've also included curriculum materials to complement the game, making it easy for teachers without a computer science background to teach it.
