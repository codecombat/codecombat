## Strategies for Recruiting Students
When it comes to computer science, CodeCombat wants to ensure access and equity of our learning to all students, regardless of background, race, or socio-economic status. We know that your classroom can be diverse and we want to support your initiatives along the way to encourage learning for all students. We have provided some strategies below to assist you in recruiting students to your AP CS P class as well as engaging them along the way.

### Engage local community resources and businesses:
CodeCombat embraces computer science as a subject to prepare students for the future workforce. Students may not realize that the skills they learn in computer science are directly applied to many jobs and professions around them. In recruiting students to your class, CodeCombat recommends you look for location partnerships in your community. 
You can create “internships” or an external project so students can directly apply the skills they are learning in the classroom. This type of enriched learning will differ from any other subject and achieve long-term buy in for students. 

### Provide trial opportunities for students AND parents:
We all know about Hour of Code week during December, but there’s no reason to wait to try those. We recommend doing code nights, either as part of PTA meetings or back to school night. As CS wasn’t offered when most parents were in school, they aren’t familiar with its curriculum. In doing an opportunity to get students and parents discovering together, you can create further buy-in and investment from not only your student, but bringing a whole family on board as well.

We recommend using some of our previous Hour of Code offers or simply using our first course and curriculum guides. This will allow the parents to learn side by side with their student, and even help them in future CodeCombat assignments throughout the year.

### Create Collaborative Coding Contests and Tangible outcomes:
CodeCombat encourages students to learn through collaboration and tangible outcomes. Many students think of computer science as lines of code made up of symbols, but don’t realize that those lines create something. Leading up to your class, we recommend doing small contests to build student engagement and collaboration. A couple of things you can do:
Have students play Game Development levels. They can rate actual student work and realize they can build their own
Use arena levels (explained in further detail later) as a coding contest
Do Stand Ups in your class. This will get students working together and speaking about current challenges

### Start a lunch, afterschool, or elective club in the spring before:
Students aren’t always thinking about fall courses ahead of time. To build a foundation, you can use CodeCombat in an afterschool, lunch, or elective club the spring before. We have multiple resources available to get your students excited and provide a foundation of understanding to prepare them even more in your AP CS P course.

### Build computer science identities and outcomes:
Most students know a computer scientist or use a device that runs from code, but don’t realize it. CodeCombat wants to make computer science more accessible for students, so we made our heroes range from both genders and multiple races to allow students to pick one that may look like them. We want students to achieve an understanding by teaching students about computer scientist role models, particularly famous women or minorities. 
You can also demonstrate to your students how the every day resources they use and interests they have related to CS. Building a connection between CS and things students wouldn’t have thought of (examples: facebook/instagram, toys, drones, etc)

### Break down access barriers:
A lot of students think CS is a huge commitment, needing a computer and devices at all times. You can break down those conceived notions if your school has a 1:1 device initiative, or you can proactively book times in computer labs. The key is to make the student feel that access to computer science learning is impossible to escape. At CodeCombat, our platform is web-based so can be accessed via a multitude of devices that carry web browsers.
