# Unit 3: Designing Arcade Games
-----
*This section should take you an estimated two hours.*

The keystone project of Unit 3 lies at the end of the Game Development 2 levels, where students will have a chance to design and implement a complex, Pac-Man style arcade game [1.2], incorporating skills to construct algorithms from the previous unit into a game development environment. In contrast to Unit 1’s Game Development levels, which focused on declarative syntax that enabled students to define in-game properties and spawn objects, this unit’s levels challenge students to think more broadly about game mechanics -- questioning and dissecting what makes a game engaging, how games can be tuned to easier or harder difficulty. As another practice opportunity for the final Create task, it also encourages students to improve their communication and collaboration skills around program design and intentionality, both as a game designer and as a game player. 

This unit also picks up where the previous left off in terms of understanding abstraction. Where in Unit 2, students learned about the specific abstractions that drive the Internet, they are now ready to approach abstractions as a concept more broadly, to start seeing how abstractions can be powerful frameworks to enable complex systems design [2.2, 5.3].  

In keeping with our mission to prepare students for the job market, and being cognizant of the ways in which engineering skills combined with humanities and civics is the way of the future, this unit also introduces students to crowdsourcing, a method by which many real-world engineers and computer scientists collaborate to solve large-scale problems [7.1]. They will also have an opportunity to connect last unit’s exploration of the Internet with an abstraction that allows them to engage with modelling and simulation [6.2]]

## Enduring Understandings
- EU 1.2 Computing enables people to use creative development processes to create computational artifacts for creative expression or to solve a problem.
- EU 2.2 Multiple levels of abstraction are used to write programs or create other computational artifacts.
- EU 5.3 Programming is facilitated by appropriate abstractions.
- EU 6.2 Characteristics of the Internet influence the systems built on it.
- EU 7.1 Computing enhances communication, interaction, and cognition.


This unit encapsulates the curriculum listed above. The corresponding CodeCombat courses are CS2 and GD2. If you haven’t played these courses earlier when we introduced “What is CodeCombat,” feel free to play it now. You can access any course or level through your [Teacher Account Course Guides](https://codecombat.com/teachers/courses) . 

As part of CodeCombat’s professional development, complete at least one of the Unit 3 activities below, which will also allow you to understand how computational thinking practices are woven throughout this unit.

### [Refactoring](https://codecombat.com/teachers/resources/apcsp-refactoring) :  
This activity will allow you to practice your comfortability around abstractions. After this activity, you will be able to develop an abstraction when writing a computational artifact, but also be able to identify multiple levels of abstractions. Try the activity yourself and see how many ways you can simplify the level, [The Agrippa Defense](https://codecombat.com/play/level/the-agrippa-defense), before moving onto the 2nd half of activities. 

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs:  P2: Creating Computational Artifacts, P3: Abstracting, P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts.

### [Palimpsest (Game Dev 2 Final)](https://codecombat.com/play/level/game-dev-2-final-project?course=57b621e7ad86a6efb5737e64&codeLanguage=python) : 
You can play it yourself and do your own creation. It may call for some more advanced functions, so at minimum you should look at student examples below, examine the [project guide](https://codecombat.com/teachers/resources/gd2) , and use the [project rubric](http://files.codecombat.com.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/resources/GD1_Project_Rubric.pdf)  to evaluate. 

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P2: Creating Computational Artifacts, P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts, P6: Collaborating.

### [Chat Room Simulation](https://codecombat.com/teachers/resources/apcsp-internet-chat-simulation) : 
Imagine how you’d facilitate this activity in your class. It requires a group, but is essential for understanding computational systems. You’ll be able to explain characteristics and systems of the internet through this activity and problem solve through simulation. 
After brainstorming how you’ll run it, look at the [Unit 3 Teacher Forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp)  thread to discuss with teachers other best practices and even gather a group to try it yourself!

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P3: Abstracting, P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts, P5: Communicating.

### [Technology Usability Review](https://codecombat.com/teachers/resources/apcsp-tech-usability) : 
After this activity, you can now explain how computing innovations affect communication and interaction. You can do this activity on your own (be sure to choose a website or app before reading the article). This activity can be applied multiple times throughout the year, applying the usability heuristic to any product. 
Share your example on the [Unit 3 Teacher Forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp) thread and see how other teachers have utilized the activity in their class.

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts.
