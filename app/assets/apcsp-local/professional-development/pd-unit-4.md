# Unit 4: Abstractions are Magic
-----
*This section should take you an estimated two hours.*

In previous units, students were exposed to the concepts of abstraction by way of thinking about how the internet works, and by developing their own abstractions inside program code. In Unit 4, the goal is to demonstrate the power and magic of abstractions by exploring how they are used in other areas of computing -- from how abstractions are fundamental to how computer hardware works to translate human-readable code into forms that a machine can interpret [2.1], to higher levels of abstraction that allow programs to interact with each other, providing inputs and outputs without necessitating that each program knows the entirety of the code [2.2]. 

In parallel, students will be completing levels in Computer Science 3 -- which covers more advanced programming concepts like functions with returns, booleans, and arithmetic [5.5] -- as well as beginning the Game Development 3 levels, which begins to scaffold how students will build their own abstractions, enabling ever-more complex computational artifacts culminating in the final game development level in the next unit and the Create task. 

Having this foundational knowledge enables students to confidently approach one of the more challenging projects in this curriculum -- the Simulation activity, which provides students with a complex model of prey-predator behavior and gives them the levers to adjust and change the outcomes [2.3]. 

## Enduring Understandings
- EU 2.1 A variety of abstractions built on binary sequences can be used to represent all digital data.
- EU 2.2 Multiple levels of abstraction are used to write programs or create other computational artifacts.
- EU 2.3 Models and simulations use abstraction to generate new understanding and knowledge.
- EU 5.5 Programming uses mathematical and logical concepts.
- EU 7.2 Computing enables innovation in nearly every field.


This unit encapsulates the curriculum listed above. The corresponding CodeCombat courses are CS3 and GD3. If you haven’t played these courses earlier when we introduced “What is CodeCombat,” feel free to play it now. You can access any course or level through your [Teacher Account Course Guides](https://codecombat.com/teachers/courses) . 

As part of CodeCombat’s professional development, complete at least one of the Unit 4 activities below, which will also allow you to understand how computational thinking practices are woven throughout this unit.

### [Binary Sequences](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/markdown/apcsp-binary-sequences) : 
The activities here explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data. And the data is important for deciphering things across the internet. Do both activities in here and post in [teacher forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp)  (unit 4 thread) a message in binary code. 
If you’d like to learn more about binary, [find a blog post here](https://medium.com/basecs/bits-bytes-building-with-binary-13cb4289aafa) . 

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P3: Abstracting.

### [Peasants and Munchkins](https://codecombat.com/play/level/peasants-and-munchkins) : 
This is a simulation activity that allows you to formulate, test, and refine hypothesis of models to complete objectives. This is a very important process in computer science as students think critically on how to attack problems, they must also test them. You can control many variables to create different scenarios. Check out [the simulation activity guide](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/markdown/apcsp-simulation) for further assistance and guidance.

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P2: Creating Computational Artifacts, P3: Abstracting.

### [Personal & Global Impact](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/markdown/apcsp-personal-and-global-impact) : 
Doing this activity will give you a full fledged lesson plan for your class. It requires you to gather materials and articles that will get your students thinking about computational artifacts, computing innovations, accessing information, and explaining connections between computing and real world context. 
After you’ve gathered your articles, you’ll have a lesson plan activity fully developed and ready to go for your students! Feel free to share them on the [teacher forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp) .

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P1: Connecting Computing, P2: Creating Computational Artifacts, P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts, P5: Communicating.
