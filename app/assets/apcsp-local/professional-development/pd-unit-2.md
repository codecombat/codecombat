# Unit 2: Thinking in Algorithms
-----
*This section should take you an estimated three hours.*

In this unit, students will focus the bulk of their efforts towards understanding algorithms, the building blocks of program code. Our approach highlights the power of different algorithm structures and how they can be combined and modified to solve ever-more complex problems with ease and efficiency [4.1, 4.2].This continues to build on the confidence that we’re establishing with students in Programming and Algorithms -- after spending time in the first unit learning the basics of syntax in either JavaScript or Python, the challenges in Computer Science 2 [5.2] allow them to explore writing basic algorithms. Understanding algorithms will help students as their code complexity increases, and will specifically allow them to tackle the Create task’s algorithmic requirements with ease further in the course. 

While the bulk of unit 2 focuses on what algorithms are, how they are used and provides opportunities for students to practice writing them, a portion of the unit is also dedicated to introducing abstractions, which will be covered in more depth in subsequent units. Via the lens of the internet -- a utility that students comprehend and use on a daily basis -- we demonstrate how abstractions make a system extensible, flexible and adaptable [6.1]. In addition to learning about the various components of how the internet works, students will be expected to demonstrate understanding of what the internet both enables and is capable of [7.3]

## Enduring Understandings
- EU 4.1 Algorithms are precise sequences of instructions for processes that can be executed by a computer and are implemented using programming languages.
- EU 4.2 Algorithms can solve many, but not all, computational problems.
- EU 5.2 People write programs to execute algorithms.
- EU 6.1 The Internet is a network of autonomous systems.
- EU 7.1 Computing enhances communication, interaction, and cognition.
- EU 7.3 Computing has global effects — both beneficial and harmful — on people and society.


This unit encapsulates the curriculum listed above. The corresponding CodeCombat courses is CS2. If you haven’t played this course earlier when we introduced “What is CodeCombat,” feel free to play it now. You can access any course or level through your [Teacher Course Guides](https://codecombat.com/teachers/courses) . 

As part of CodeCombat’s professional development, complete at least one of the Unit 2 activities below, which will also allow you to understand how computational thinking practices are woven throughout this unit.

### [Searching & Sorting](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/markdown/apcsp-search-sort) : 
This activity focuses on the concept of algorithms, specifically the pros and cons of the different types of algorithms. After exploring this activity, you should be able to explain the difference between algorithms and weigh pros and cons of each.

Think about which type of algorithm may work best for your students in certain scenarios. Algorithms are meant to make problem solving more efficient depending on the objective at hand. After reviewing the activity for class, share any ways you can edit the activity further on the [teacher forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp) (use the Unit 2 thread).

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P1: Connecting Computing, P3: Abstracting, P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts

### [Hitchhikers Guide](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/markdown/apcsp-hitchhikers-guide) : 
This activity focuses on attacking problems that seem impossible or undecidable on the surface. In problem solving to meet certain objectives, you can use algorithms as a manner to develop a solution.
After this activity, you should be able to determine the types of problems that arise in computer science as solvable or unsolvable. You should feel comfortable leading discussions and finding other potential undecidable problems that you could utilize in your class. 

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P3: Abstracting, P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts, P5: Communicating.

### [Big Data](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/markdown/apcsp-big-data) :
This activity focuses on how data & information is essential to computer science. After this activity you will be able to determine how large data sets impact the discovery of information as well as how data is represented and stored can affect the outcome.
Choose one of the activities (Census Explorer or Group Data Exploration) within this page and try it out. Post your answers to the discussion questions on the [teacher forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp)  and we will respond.

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P2: Creating Computational Artifacts, P3: Abstracting, P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts, P5: Communicating.
