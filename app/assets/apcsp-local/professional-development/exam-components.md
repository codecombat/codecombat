# Exam Components
-----

The AP CS Principles Exam is a two part exam: performance tasks and the end-of-course AP Ecam. Both measure student achievement of the course learning objectives (that are laid out in our curriculum hub). 

#### **Through-Course Assessments**

The performance tasks make up 40% of the overall AP Score.
- Create — Applications from Ideas | 24% | 12 hours
- Explore — Impact of Computing Innovations | 16% | 8 hours

The Create Task focuses on the creation of a computer program or artifact through the collaborative process of programming.

The Explore Task requires students to identify a computing innovation, explores its impact, and create a related digital artifact accompanied by a written response. 

Teachers are required to set aside 8 hours of in-class time for the Explore task, and 12 hours for the Create task. CodeCombat’s curriculum sets aside time for the final Explore task be done in conjunction with Unit 2, and the final Create task be done in conjunction with Unit 5. There are opportunities to practice each of those tasks with teacher oversight before the final tasks. Below, we outline ways for students to practice and understand the rubrics for these tasks well in advance of the final projects.

[Assessment Overview and Performance Task directions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles): This is the assessment overview and performance task directions for students. As the instructor, you are required to provide this resource to your students. We recommend printing copies for each student in your class at the beginning of the school year and using the guide as references as students encounter assessment opportunities in each Unit. These directions contain:
- An assessment overview
- Explore performance task directions
- Create performance task directions
- Exam reference sheet
- Scoring guidelines and notes

As an instructor, you should be familiar with each and every step for your students to follow.

[Scoring Guidelines and Notes for Exam & Sample Responses for Create & Explore Task](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam?course=ap-computer-science-principles#anchorSG) This page has multiple Explore and Create task references for you to share with your students. This page is meant to help instructors set a benchmark and gain an understanding of how their students will be measured on the Performance Task portion of the exam. (You will review this again in Unit 6 as well as partake in an activity for sample evaluation). 

[AP Digital Portfolio details](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/resources/about-ap-digital-portfolio?course=ap-computer-science-principles)  This is where you can learn about the AP Digital Portfolio. The AP Digital Portfolio is where students will upload digital artifacts for the Performance Tasks of the exam. The details breaks down what is required for you, the instructor, to make sure your students complete the tasks for appropriate scoring. As part of CodeCombat’s professional development, teachers should familiarize themselves with the submission process so that they are able to guide students through the Explore and Create task submissions in Units 2 and 5, respectively. 

Additional detail about these tasks can be found in the [AP CS Principles Course Description](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf) starting from page 71. We also encourage you to refer to our curriculum hub pages on the [Explore Task](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/curriculum/explore), [Create Task](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/curriculum/performance-tasks#performance-task-create), and [performance task overview](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/curriculum/performance-tasks). 
 starting from page 71.

#### **End of Course Assessment**
The End of Course exam is 74 multiple-choice questions that makes up 60% of overall AP Score.

We will provide further details and resources in [Unit 6](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/professional-development/pd-unit-6) of this professional development specifically related to the AP Exam components.
