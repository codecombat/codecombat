# Unit 5: Connecting Computing
-----
*This section should take you an estimated two hours.*

The final instructive unit of our curriculum connects each of the important concepts that students have been exploring throughout the year to a larger understanding -- that computing is powerful and that students themselves can effect change in the world via computing [3.1]. As students look at real-world applications of the concepts they’ve been building up to, through investigations into datasets [3.2, 3.3], understanding how the complexities of information is transmitted across the internet [6.3], our approach allows them to see how they can become active participants and creators of the technology around them. As reflected in our core values, this completes the student’s journey from a passive consumer of computing to “a computer scientist” in their own right [7.4]. 

This unit allows students to finish the Game Development 3 levels they began in the previous unit, culminating in the final practice opportunity for the Create task -- students build an infinite-runner type game that challenges them to use the abstraction and algorithmic skills they’ve learned to craft a finely tuned game. This, coupled with reflection and iteration opportunities built into the curriculum, sets students up for success as they approach their final Create task.  

## Enduring Understandings
- EU 3.1 People use computer programs to process information to gain insight and knowledge.
- EU 3.2 Computing facilitates exploration and the discovery of connections in information.
- EU 3.3 There are trade-offs when representing information as digital data.
- EU 6.3 Cybersecurity is an important concern for the Internet and the systems built on it.
- EU 7.4 Computing innovations influence and are influenced by the economic, social, and cultural contexts in which they are designed and used.

This unit encapsulates the curriculum listed above. The corresponding CodeCombat courses are CS3 and GD3. If you haven’t played these courses earlier when we introduced “What is CodeCombat,” feel free to play it now. You can access any course or level through your [Teacher Account Course Guides](https://codecombat.com/teachers/courses) . 

As part of CodeCombat’s professional development, complete at least one of the Unit 5 activities below, which will also allow you to understand how computational thinking practices are woven throughout this unit.

### [Lossy & Lossless Compression](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/markdown/apcsp-compression) : 
After this activity, you will be able to explain the difference and effects of compression. There are trade-offs when representing information with data, this activity will provide insight to you and your students as to what they are and give you confidence on how data is involved with computational manipulation.

After you’ve done the video analysis portion of the activity, share any findings or links on the [teacher forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp) . Also search there for ones you may not have thought of. 

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts.

### [Cybersecurity](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/markdown/apcsp-internet-cybersecurity) : 
After this activity, you will be able to identify existing cybersecurity concerns and use critical thinking skills to develop potential solutions. You can use real-world examples or hypotheticals depending on how you want to engage your students. We recommend doing a real-world example for your work today.

After reviewing an example, can you think of potential future cybersecurity threats? Please share them on the [teacher forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp) .

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P1: Connecting Computing, P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts.

### [How the Internet Works](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/markdown/apcsp-how-the-internet-works) : 
This activity dives into the intricacies of the internet system. It will require you to hypothesize and test your own ideas on the internet. At the end, you will be able to explain the abstractions and functionalities of the internet, as well as its systems.
The discussion questions here can easily be converted to an assessment depending on your objectives for this unit in class.

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P3: Abstracting, P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts, P5: Communicating.
