# Unit 6: Preparing for the Exam:
-----
*This section should take you an estimated two hours.*

As we laid out previously in the [Components of the Exam section](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/professional-development/exam-components) at the beginning of this portal, the last component of your curriculum is the AP CS Principles Exam. It is made up of three sections: Create Task, Explore Task, and Multiple Choice. Below you’ll find all College Board materials and directions to prepare you for the exam logistics and deadlines.

a. [Practice exam](https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles/exam-practice): This is the College Board AP practice exam for Computer Science Principles. You’ll find sample questions as well as an overview and guidelines to prepare for the various tasks to be assessed on the exam. As part of Codecombat professional development, teachers should briefly review the exam in order to understand its struture and breadth.
Additionally, once you have gone through the Course Audit process that we listed as your first step on the [What is AP CS Principles](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/professional-development/apcsp-101) page, you will have access to an additional full length practice exam.

b. [AP Central resources](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles?course=ap-computer-science-principles): This College Board AP Hub for Computer Science Principles lists the latest course and exam description, updates on the course, and latest Performance Task samples to help prepare for the exam. Many of the important resources in this hub will be familiar to participants who have gone through CodeCombat’s professional development.

c. [AP Teacher Community](https://apcommunity.collegeboard.org/web/apcsp/): You are not alone! This community connects AP CS Principles teachers worldwide. In addition to required discussion participation as a part of CodeCombat’s professional development, teachers can use this forum to share strategies and get clarification from other students as well as our CodeCombat school experts. Come here to engage in discussion on lively topics, post and rate AP classroom materials, browse the curriculum framework, and connect with colleagues to grow your network.

The next three sections look familiar from the [Exam Components page earlier](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/professional-development/exam-components). We are providing the information again as part of the Through-Course Assessment materials, AND an activity so you can practice how these tasks will be evaluated to better prepare your students.

d. [AP Digital Portfolio details](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/resources/about-ap-digital-portfolio?course=ap-computer-science-principles)  This is where you can learn about the AP Digital Portfolio. The AP Digital Portfolio is where students will upload digital artifacts for the Performance Tasks of the exam. The details breaks down what is required for you, the instructor, to make sure your students complete the tasks for appropriate scoring. As part of CodeCombat’s professional development, teachers should familiarize themselves with the submission process so that they are able to guide students through the Explore and Create task submissions in Units 2 and 5, respectively. 

It provides necessary resources such as the timeline and process throughout the school year, and a video highlighting the steps students must take. 

*This is a must-bookmark resource for all AP CS Principles instructors*

e. [Assessment Overview and Performance Task directions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles): This is the assessment overview and performance task directions for students. As the instructor, you are required to provide this resource to your students. We recommend printing copies for each student in your class at the beginning of the school year and using the guide as references as students encounter assessment opportunities in each Unit. These directions contain:
- An assessment overview
- Explore performance task directions
- Create performance task directions
- Exam reference sheet
- Scoring guidelines and notes

As an instructor, you should be familiar with each and every step for your students to follow.

f. [Scoring Guidelines and Notes for Exam & Sample Responses for Create & Explore Task](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam?course=ap-computer-science-principles#anchorSG) This page has multiple Explore and Create task references for you to share with your students. This page is meant to help instructors set a benchmark and gain an understanding of how their students will be measured on the Performance Task portion of the exam. 

As part of CodeCombat’s professional development, teachers should complete the following activity to familiarize themselves with the ins and outs of the scoring rubrics for these Performance tasks.  (should take no longer than 1 hour):
1. Choose two Explore sample responses and two Create sample responses
2. Using the respective scoring Guidelines and Notes, (Explore scoring guidelines here and Create scoring guidelines here), you will evaluate the sample responses you have chosen
3. Collect your notes and scores and post it on the CodeCombat AP CS Principles [Teacher Forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp) under Unit 6. The questions focus on your findings in the sample responses. 
4. Lastly, compare your notes against the commentary and notes from College Board
This activity will prepare you and your students for expectations on the exam.

[College Board AP CS Principles FAQ](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course/frequently-asked-questions?course=ap-computer-science-principles)  Great resource of Frequently Asked Questions from other instructors to College Board.
