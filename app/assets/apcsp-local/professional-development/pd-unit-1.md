# Unit 1: Who is a Computer Scientist?
-----
*This section should take you an estimated three hours.*

Students begin the course focusing on Creativity, Programming and Global Impact, setting the tone for CodeCombat’s holistic approach to computer science. They will have hands-on experience with programming right out of the gate with the first programming component, Introduction to Computer Science, which leads them through learning basic coding concepts from sequencing to while loops [5.1, 5.4]. They’ll also work through the Web Development 1 and Game Development 1 courses, which provide two opportunities to create standalone projects that can be shared with their friends and family [1.2, 1.3, P2]. 

Building programming confidence from the very start is a critical component to our curriculum strategy -- in recognizing current challenges with student recruitment and retention, we wanted to ensure that we quickly dispel notions that only certain types of students were ‘good at coding’. Through various collaborative and teacher-driven activities [P6], students learn how to work through the engineering cycle [1.1, P4] in a process they can later replicate to solve more complex problems and build more complex artifacts. 

In keeping with our mission to prepare students for the job market, and being cognizant of the ways in which engineering skills combined with humanities and civics is the way of the future, this unit also introduces students to crowdsourcing, a method by which many real-world engineers and computer scientists collaborate to solve large-scale problems [7.1]. 

## Enduring Understandings
- EU 1.1 Creative development can be an essential process for creating computational artifacts.
- EU 1.2 Computing enables people to use creative development processes to create computational artifacts for creative expression or to solve a problem.
- EU 1.3 Computing can extend traditional forms of human expression and experience.
- EU 5.1 Programs can be developed for creative expression, to satisfy personal curiosity, to create new knowledge, or to solve - problems (to help people, organizations, or society).
- EU 5.4 Programs are developed, maintained, and used by people for different purposes.
- EU 7.1 Computing enhances communication, interaction, and cognition.

This unit encapsulates the curriculum listed above. You can see further explanation in the curriculum hub. The corresponding CodeCombat courses are Introduction to Computer Science, Web Development 1, and Game Development 1. If you haven’t played them earlier when we introduced “What is CodeCombat,” feel free to play them now. You can access any course or level through your [Teacher Course Guides](https://codecombat.com/teachers/courses).

As part of CodeCombat’s professional development, complete at least one of the Unit 1 activities below, which will also allow you to understand how computational thinking practices are woven throughout this unit.

### [Visit level Tabula Rasa in Game Development 1](https://codecombat.com/play/level/tabula-rasa?course=5789587aad86a6efb573701e&codeLanguage=python).
This is the final level and requires you to put together your own level to play. In this activity, you will gain an understanding of student’s ability to be creativity and apply algorithm concepts into a finished product. This is an essential step to any create task project. Your students will do this as part of their curriculum and you can use a [project rubric](http://files.codecombat.com.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/resources/GD1_Project_Rubric.pdf) to even evaluate their projects. (If stuck, check out the [full project guide for Game Development 1](https://codecombat.com/apcsp/markdown/gd1-5day).
Much like how your students will be sharing their creations, we encourage you to share projects (and questions) on the [teacher forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp) (Look for the Unit 1 PD thread). You can leave feedback on others or ask for feedback on yours.

[Here is a game development 1 example](https://codecombat.com/play/game-dev-level/590909f01325691c007964d8) for reference. (Note that this is an unofficial non-required performance task exemplar). 

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P1: Connecting Computing, P2: Creating Computational Artifacts.

### [Visit level Wanted Poster in Web Development 1](https://codecombat.com/play/level/wanted-poster?course=5789587aad86a6efb573701f&codeLanguage=javascript). 
This is the final level and requires you to put together your own images and text. Your students will do this and you can test out examples of what they will do with your own creation. 
After this exercise, you will have a deeper understanding of how creativity and programming go hand in hand. Much like the previous activity, we encourage you to share projects (and questions) on the [teacher forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp) (Look for the Unit 1 PD thread). You can leave feedback on others or ask for feedback on yours.

[Here is a web development 1 example for reference](https://codecombat.com/play/web-dev-level/579fbd99f380c444007e63d1)  (Note that this is an unofficial non-required performance task exemplar). 

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P1: Connecting Computing, P2: Creating Computational Artifacts.

### [Engage in our Crowdsourcing activity](https://codecombat.com/teachers/resources/apcsp-crowdsourcing). 
This activity calls for you to examine technology collaboration. This activity will enforce analysis of computational artifacts as well as participate in problem-solving skills. 
You will answer Discussion Questions and think about the internet in new ways through it. Please choose your favorite discussion question and share your response and thoughts on the [teacher forum](https://groups.google.com/a/codecombat.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/apcsp) . Feel free to comment on other teacher’s responses. 

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts, P6: Collaboration.

### [Review Pair Programming activity](https://codecombat.com/teachers/resources/pair-programming). 
This is a best practice to encourage collaboration amongst pairs with different strengths and weaknesses. Take a moment to write out how you’d use this activity in your class while working on problems.

This activity will also allow you to engage with the following CTPs: P1: Connecting Computing, P6: Collaboration.
