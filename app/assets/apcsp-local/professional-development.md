# CodeCombat Professional Development
-----

Welcome to the CodeCombat Professional Development Portal. This area will guide you through the ins and outs of the AP CS Principles resources available to you within CodeCombat. You will cover things from basic syntax to global impact of computer science in this robust covering. 

This is a self-paced learning environment, but please estimate 15 hours to complete all information and activities within here. It does not need to be done in one sitting but we recommend following the sequence we have listed in the table of contents. We will point out resources for you along the way to support with any questions you may have. Good luck and happy coding!
