#    why_python_blurb: "Python is both beginner-friendly and currently used by major corporations (such as Google). If you have younger or first-time learners, we strongly recommend Python."
#    why_javascript: "Why should you choose JavaScript?"
#    why_javascript_blurb: "JavaScript is the language of the web and is used across nearly every website. You may prefer to choose JavaScript if you are planning to also study web development. We’ve also made it easy for students to transition from Python to JavaScript-based web development."
#    javascript_versus_python: "JavaScript’s syntax is a little more difficult for beginners than Python, so if you cannot decide between the two, we recommend Python."

#    main_curriculum_blurb: "Absolutely! We’ve spent time consulting with education specialists to craft classroom curriculum and materials specifically for teachers who are using CodeCombat or Ozaria without any prior computer science experience themselves. Many schools are implementing CodeCombat and/or Ozaria as the main computer science curriculum."

#    paragraph2: "The students of Bobby Duke Middle School reflect the socioeconomic challenges facing Coachella Valley’s residents and students within the district. With over 95% of the Bobby Duke Middle School student population qualifying for free and reduced-price meals and over 40% classified as English language learners, the importance of teaching 21st century skills was the top priority of Bobby Duke Middle School Technology teacher, Scott Baily."
#    paragraph3: "Baily knew that teaching his students coding was a key pathway to opportunity in a job landscape that increasingly prioritizes and necessitates computing skills. So, he decided to take on the exciting challenge of creating and teaching the only coding class in the school and finding a solution that was affordable, responsive to feedback, and engaging to students of all learning abilities and backgrounds."

That is why we are partnering with libraries across the country to provide access to our game-based learning tools and educational resources."
#    games_teach_blurb: "Our games teach real typed Python, JavaScript and C++ coding languages through the power of play. The gameplay is paired with a scaffolded curriculum to allow self-paced learners the ability to master foundational programming concepts before moving on to the more complex. Each level challenges the player to type the code necessary to advance their hero and achieve the level goal."
