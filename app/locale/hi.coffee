#    paragraph2: "The students of Bobby Duke Middle School reflect the socioeconomic challenges facing Coachella Valley’s residents and students within the district. With over 95% of the Bobby Duke Middle School student population qualifying for free and reduced-price meals and over 40% classified as English language learners, the importance of teaching 21st century skills was the top priority of Bobby Duke Middle School Technology teacher, Scott Baily."
#    paragraph3: "Baily knew that teaching his students coding was a key pathway to opportunity in a job landscape that increasingly prioritizes and necessitates computing skills. So, he decided to take on the exciting challenge of creating and teaching the only coding class in the school and finding a solution that was affordable, responsive to feedback, and engaging to students of all learning abilities and backgrounds."
