#    for_girls_title: "Is it for girls?"
#    for_girls_1: "There are three game modes in CodeCombat: building, puzzles, and combat. We have intentionally designed each to appeal to both boys and girls and think that the building and puzzle levels especially differentiate the game from violent triple A titles that repel female players."

We have optimized it to run quickly on all modern browsers and on older machines so that everyone can play. That said, here are our suggestions for getting the most out of the CodeCombat experience:"
#    sys_requirements_2: "Use newer versions of Chrome or Firefox."

#    sys_requirements_4: "Use newer computers."
#    sys_requirements_5: "Older computers, Chromebooks, and netbooks tend to have very few system resources, which makes for a less enjoyable experience. At least 2GB of RAM is required."
