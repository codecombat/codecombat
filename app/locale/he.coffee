#    why_paragraph_1: "When making Skritter, George didn't know how to program and was constantly frustrated by his inability to implement his ideas. Afterwards, he tried learning, but the lessons were too slow. His housemate, wanting to reskill and stop teaching, tried Codecademy, but \"got bored.\" Each week another friend started Codecademy, then dropped off. We realized it was the same problem we'd solved with Skritter: people learning a skill via slow, intensive lessons when what they need is fast, extensive practice. We know how to fix that."
