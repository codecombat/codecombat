CodeCombat is a multiplayer programming game for learning how to code. **See the [Archmage developer wiki](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Archmage-Home) for a dev setup guide, extensive documentation, and much more.**

It's both a startup and a community project, completely open source under the [MIT and Creative Commons licenses](http://codecombat.com/legal). It's the largest open source [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) project by lines of code, and since it's a game (with [really cool tech](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Third-party-software-and-services)), it's really fun to hack on. Join us in teaching the world to code! Your contribution will go on to show millions of players how cool programming can be.

### [Getting Started](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Developer-environment)

We've made it easy to fork the project, run a simple script that'll install all the dependencies, and get a local copy of CodeCombat running right away on Mac, Linux, or Windows. See [the docs for details](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Developer-environment).

### [License](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/LICENSE)

[MIT](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/LICENSE) for the code, and [CC-BY](http://codecombat.com/legal) for the art and music. Please also [sign the CodeCombat contributor license agreement](http://codecombat.com/cla) so we can accept your pull requests. It is easy.
